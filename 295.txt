Why has Easter turned into a time to celebrate finding chocolate \/ eggs from a bunny ? In all honesty i do n't get how they relate Please explain like I'm five.<>They do n't . Decorating eggs seems to be a festive activity dating back to antiquity . The rabbit , or the hare , was a common symbol in Christianity , and European culture in general . The practice seems to come from German Protestants , who rejected the Catholic practice of fasting during Easter in favour of continuing to dye and eat eggs . Given that eggs were prohibited during Lent , this also made them significantly cheaper , so it has a semi - practical explanation . Like a lot of things , German practices came into English practice through the royal family , which was ' imported ' from Germany in the 17th century , when George I ascended to the British throne .<>Easter is a holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is an important event in the Christian religion. The tradition of giving chocolate eggs at Easter is thought to have originated in Europe, where eggs were given as gifts to celebrate springtime. The Easter bunny, which is a popular symbol of Easter, is said to deliver these chocolate eggs as a gift to children. The connection between the Easter bunny and Easter eggs may have come about because bunnies are often associated with spring and new life, which are themes that are central to the holiday of Easter.<>reddit_eli5
