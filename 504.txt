Please explain what is \"Yann LeCun\"<>Yann André LeCun (\/ləˈkʌn\/ lə-KUN, French: [ləkœ̃]; originally spelled Le Cun; born 8 July 1960) is a French computer scientist working primarily in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics and computational neuroscience. He is the Silver Professor of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and Vice-President, Chief AI Scientist at Meta.\nHe is well known for his work on optical character recognition and computer vision using convolutional neural networks (CNN), and is a founding father of convolutional nets. He is also one of the main creators of the DjVu image compression technology (together with Léon Bottou and Patrick Haffner). He co-developed the Lush programming language with Léon Bottou.\nLeCun received the 2018 Turing Award (often referred to as \"Nobel Prize of Computing\"), together with Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, for their work on deep learning.\nThe three are sometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of AI\" and \"Godfathers of Deep Learning\".[10][11][12][13]<>Yann LeCun is a computer scientist and electrical engineer who is known for his work in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. He is currently the Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and a professor at New York University, where he leads the NYU Center for Data Science.\n\n\n\nLeCun is widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the field of deep learning, a type of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks to process and analyze large amounts of data. He is credited with developing the first convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of neural network that is particularly effective at recognizing patterns and features in images, and has played a key role in advancing the use of CNNs in a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.\n\n\n\nLeCun has received numerous awards and accolades for his work, including the Turing Award, which is considered the \"Nobel Prize\" of computing, and the Japan Prize, which is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology. He is also a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).<>wiki_csai
