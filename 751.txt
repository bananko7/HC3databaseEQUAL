Applying vaseline for reddishness around penis for years. Should I be worried?I have been having reddishness around my penis for the past 2-3 years. My urologist has suggested applying   Vaseline around it. I see the reddishness sometimes less but it has not gone completely. No other symptoms, no pain. Is this something I need not worry about.<>HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern the redness that you are seeing might not be due to any disease or skin lesion but this could be a natural appearance, that does not need any treatment in my opinion the Vaseline, should be stop this is not the medicine, just leave it like that only, when it is not associated with any other symptoms then why to tampered it, stop worrying about this, hope this information helps you take care and have nice day.<>It is not normal to have persistent redness around the penis, and it is important to address this issue with a healthcare professional. While Vaseline may provide temporary relief, it is not a long-term solution and it is important to determine the underlying cause of the redness.\n\nThere are many potential causes of redness around the penis, including skin irritation, fungal or bacterial infections, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and allergic reactions. It is important to see a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. They may recommend further testing or treatment, such as the use of topical or oral medications, to address the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to practice good hygiene, such as washing the area daily with warm water and avoiding tight clothing, to help prevent further irritation.<>medicine
