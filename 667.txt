Why can't I open multiple sell orders?<>From the message you report, it sounds like you are trying to sell the same shares twice, you have two open sell orders for the same shares. Either you have accidentally entered two sell orders, or the web site is having a technical problem. I'm not a customer of Fidelity so I can't say what their web site looks like, but there should be some screen that shows your open orders. If looking there doesn't resolve the issue, call customer service.<>It's possible that you are unable to open multiple sell orders because your brokerage or trading platform has certain restrictions in place that limit the number of open orders you can have at any given time. Alternatively, it could be that you don't have sufficient funds or buying power in your account to support multiple sell orders. Finally, it's possible that there is some issue with the platform or app you are using that is preventing you from opening multiple sell orders. Without more information, it's difficult to say exactly what the issue might be.<>finance
