Please explain what is \"Computational fluid dynamics\"<>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows.  Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid (liquids and gases) with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as wind tunnels.  In addition, previously performed analytical or empirical analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison.  A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing, such as flight tests.\nCFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries, including aerodynamics and aerospace analysis, hypersonics, weather simulation, natural science and environmental engineering, industrial system design and analysis, biological engineering, fluid flows and heat transfer, engine and combustion analysis, and visual effects for film and games.<>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flow. It involves the use of computers to perform simulations of fluid flow, heat transfer, and other related phenomena.\n\n\n\nCFD can be used to study a wide range of problems, including the flow of air over an aircraft wing, the design of a cooling system for a power plant, or the mixing of fluids in a chemical reactor. It is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting fluid behavior in complex systems, and can be used to optimize the design of systems that involve fluid flow.\n\n\n\nCFD simulations typically involve solving a set of equations that describe the behavior of the fluid, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are typically solved using advanced numerical techniques, such as the finite element method or the finite volume method. The results of the simulations can be used to understand the behavior of the fluid and to make predictions about how the system will behave under different conditions.\n\n\n\nCFD is a rapidly growing field, and it is used in a wide range of industries, including aerospace, automotive, chemical engineering, and many others. It is an important tool for understanding and optimizing the performance of systems that involve fluid flow.<>wiki_csai
