I will do my best to help you understand the concept of expense growth as it may be relevant to the diagram you are looking at.In general, expense growth refers to the increase in expenses or costs over a period of time. Expenses can refer to any costs incurred in the course of conducting business, such as salaries, rent, utilities, and materials. Expense growth can be measured as a percentage increase or decrease in expenses compared to a previous period. For example, if a company's expenses were $100,000 in the first quarter of the year and $110,000 in the second quarter, the expense growth would be 10%. Expense growth can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as changes in demand for a company's products or services, increases in the cost of inputs or materials, and changes in business operations or efficiency. Understanding and managing expense growth is an important part of financial planning and decision-making for businesses.<>finance
