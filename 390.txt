Why do we have cars that go over 100 mph , when we will usually never go that fast ? Would n't it be safer to make cars that only go 70 - 75 mph ? Explain like I'm five.<>Four comments : 1 . Texas has highways with 85 mph speed limits . If you were passing somebody on this highway who was going 75 mph , 95 mph would be a reasonable speed . 2 . Simply putting a weaker engine in place is a unworkable solution because weaker engines have less acceleration . Acceleration speed is incredibly important for safety . Think about when you get on a highway and have to go from 30 mph to 60 mph in a fairly short distance . You 're a hazard until you reach the speed of traffic . 3 . Cars exists with electronic limiters that stop them at from driving above certain speeds without limiting acceleration . In the united states , many of these are set at 120 mph . 4 . Consumers do n't want to buy cars with electronic limiters .<>Cars are able to go faster than the speed limit for a few reasons. One reason is that sometimes people need to go on highways or roads where the speed limit is higher than 70 or 75 mph. If a car can only go a certain speed, it might not be able to keep up with the traffic around it, which can be dangerous.\n\nAnother reason is that cars are designed to be able to handle high speeds in case of an emergency. For example, if a car is being chased by the police or if a driver needs to quickly get out of the way of a dangerous situation, the car might need to go faster to get to safety.\n\nFinally, some people just enjoy driving fast and like to have a car that can go faster than the speed limit. This is why car manufacturers make cars that can go faster than the speed limit.\n\nOverall, it's important to always follow the speed limit and drive safely, no matter how fast your car can go.<>reddit_eli5
