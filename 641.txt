Q. What causes heart palpitations for a long time?Hello doctor,I have had heart palpitations for two weeks. 3 to 6 times a day. Feeling of one hard heatbeat. I bought a holter monitor and catched it today. Seeking advice.<>Hello. This is an atrial ectopic or extra beat in other words. These occurs intermittently, so, ECG may be normal in between. These are not worrisome usually and most of the times without much significance. However, we need to rule out the possibility of structural heart disease before calling them benign. So, echo should be obtained to rule out possibility of structural heart disease. Also, thyroid problems can cause these, so thyroid profile should be obtained. Also, too much coffee, sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol and other addictions may cause those, so should be minimized, if any. If too frequent and symptomatic, then one can have beta-blockers medicine like Metoprolol which suppress these. Otherwise these settles with time.<>Heart palpitations are a sensation of feeling your heart beating in your chest, neck, or throat. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\nStress or anxiety: Emotional stress or anxiety can cause your heart rate to increase, leading to palpitations.\n\nCaffeine: Caffeine is a stimulant that can increase your heart rate and cause palpitations.\n\nSmoking: Smoking can increase your heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to palpitations.\n\nAlcohol: Alcohol, especially when consumed in large amounts, can cause palpitations by affecting the normal rhythm of your heart.\n\nHormonal changes: Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during menopause or pregnancy, can cause palpitations.\n\nMedications: Some medications, such as decongestants, asthma inhalers, and diet pills, can cause palpitations as a side effect.\n\nMedical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as an overactive thyroid or anemia, can cause palpitations.\n\nIt's important to note that heart palpitations can also be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) or heart disease. If you have had heart palpitations for a long time or if they are accompanied by other symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, it's important to speak to a healthcare professional. They will be able to evaluate your symptoms and determine the cause of your palpitations. In the meantime, it may be helpful to try to identify and avoid any triggers for your palpitations, such as caffeine or tobacco.<>medicine
