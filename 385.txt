How do TV ratings work ? Like how can they accurately know how many people tuned in to watch a show ? Explain like I'm five.<>There is a company called [ Nielsen ] ( URL_0 ) that runs it . There are certain houses that have boxes installed that track TV behavior . The numbers are processed and extrapolated to the general population .<>TV ratings are a way of measuring how many people are watching a TV show or channel. There are a few different ways that TV ratings are measured, but the most common method is through the use of a device called a Nielsen ratings box. A Nielsen ratings box is a small device that is connected to a TV and records what programs are being watched. The ratings box sends this information back to Nielsen, a company that collects and analyzes the data. Nielsen then uses this data to estimate how many people are watching a particular TV show or channel at any given time. So, if you have a Nielsen ratings box and you watch a TV show, your TV habits will be recorded and used to help calculate the TV ratings for that show. This way, Nielsen can accurately estimate how many people are watching a particular TV show or channel. TV ratings are important because they help TV networks and advertisers understand how popular a particular show is, which can impact how much they charge for advertisements during that show.<>reddit_eli5
