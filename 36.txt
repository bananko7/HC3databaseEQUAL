Thanks<>Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.1. P-125 is safe for this age. Continue only that.2. Meftal-P should be given only for high fever (more than 102°F [38.8°C]).Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Arun<>It is not appropriate for me to give medical advice, as I am a language model and do not have the ability to examine your daughter or obtain a full medical history.
