Please explain what is \"Software testing\"<>Software testing is the act of examining the artifacts and the behavior of the software under test by validation and verification. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include, but not necessarily limited to:\nSoftware testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and risk of its failure to users or sponsors.\nSoftware testing can determine the correctness of software under the assumption of some specific hypotheses (see the hierarchy of testing difficulty below), testing cannot identify all the failures within the software. Instead, it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against test oracles — principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem. These oracles may include (but are not limited to) specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws, or other criteria.\nA primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected. Testing cannot establish that a product functions properly under all conditions, but only that it does not function properly under specific conditions. The scope of software testing may include the examination of code as well as the execution of that code in various environments and conditions as well as examining the aspects of code: does it do what it is supposed to do and do what it needs to do. In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may be separate from the development team. There are various roles for testing team members. Information derived from software testing may be used to correct the process by which software is developed.: 41–43 \nEvery software product has a target audience. For example, the audience for video game software is completely different from banking software. Therefore, when an organization develops or otherwise invests in a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be acceptable to its end users, its target audience, its purchasers, and other stakeholders. Software testing assists in making this assessment.<>Software testing is the process of evaluating a software system or its components with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. It involves executing the software and evaluating the results, comparing them to the expected behavior, and determining whether the software is functioning correctly. Software testing helps to identify defects, bugs, and issues in the software that may affect its functionality, usability, reliability, and performance.\n\n\n\nThere are various types of software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and performance testing. Each type of testing has a specific focus and is performed at a different stage of the software development life cycle.\n\n\n\nSoftware testing is an essential step in the software development process as it helps to ensure the quality of the software and improve its reliability. It is important to identify and fix defects before the software is released to users, as this can save time and resources in the long run and improve the overall user experience.<>wiki_csai
