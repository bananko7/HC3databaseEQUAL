What to do with old company's 401k? [duplicate]<>Your best bets are a Roth IRA or traditional IRA.  If you roll it to a Roth, you will have to pay taxes on the amount you roll over (unless it was a Roth 401k), however what is in the Roth will grow tax free and it will be tax free when you withdraw.  With a traditional IRA, you won't owe taxes on the money now but will pay taxes when you withdraw. You won't be able to withdraw this money until 59 1\/2 years of age without paying a penalty, the same goes for your current 401k.  If you take the money (for mortgage, other investment, etc.) and don't roll it over to a qualified account, you will owe taxes on it plus a 10% penalty.  So you will only get between 60% and 70% of its value.<>If you have an old 401(k) account from a previous employer, you have several options for what to do with it:Leave the money in the old account: You can leave the money in the old 401(k) account if you are happy with the investment options and fees. However, you will not be able to contribute to the account or take out loans from it.Roll the money over into a new employer's 401(k) plan: If you are starting a new job and your new employer offers a 401(k) plan, you can roll over the money from your old 401(k) into the new plan. This allows you to continue saving for retirement and take advantage of any employer matching contributions.Roll the money over into an individual retirement account (IRA): You can also roll the money from your old 401(k) into an IRA. This gives you more control over your investment options and may offer lower fees than your old 401(k) plan.Cash out the account: You can cash out the account, but this is generally not a good idea as you will have to pay taxes on the money and may also be subject to an early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59 1\/2. Cashing out a 401(k) can also significantly reduce the amount of money you have saved for retirement.It's important to carefully consider your options and consult with a financial professional before making a decision about what to do with your old 401(k).","If you have left your former employer and have an old 401(k) account with that company, you have several options for what to do with the money in the account.
