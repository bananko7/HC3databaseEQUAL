Why do the voices in schizophrenics ' heads say negative things ? I 've always read about schizophrenics having voices in their heads talk to them , telling them to kill people or to kill themselves . Why do n't these voices say more positive things ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Typically Schizophrenics are diagnosed BECAUSE of the voices being constantly negative . there are plenty of people that \" hear voices \" that are mundane or even positive . What sets Schizo 's aside from the rest is theirs are constantly negative , or they choose to listen harder to the negative , or the negative is stronger due to some traumatic event . In any case , its not the Schizo that makes the negative thoughts , its the negative thoughts that put forth the diagnosis of Schizophrenia .<>Schizophrenia is a complex and serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is hearing voices or having other kinds of auditory hallucinations, which are experiences of hearing things that are not actually there. These voices can say all kinds of things, and they can be positive, negative, or neutral. It's not clear exactly why some people with schizophrenia hear negative voices and others do not. It is thought that these voices may be related to the person's own thoughts and feelings, as well as to changes in the brain that can occur in people with schizophrenia. It's important to remember that people with schizophrenia are not responsible for the things that their voices say, and it is not their fault that they are experiencing these kinds of hallucinations. With the right treatment and support, people with schizophrenia can learn to manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives.<>reddit_eli5
