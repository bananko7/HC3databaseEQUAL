Please explain what is \"Optical character recognition\"<>Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast).\nWidely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerized receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.\nEarly versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs. Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.<>Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technology that allows computers to recognize and process text that appears in images, such as scanned documents and digital photographs. It works by analyzing the shapes and patterns of the characters in the image and comparing them to a database of known characters. OCR software can be used to extract text from images and convert it into a digital format that can be edited and searched. OCR is commonly used in applications such as document scanning, data entry, and automatic indexing of documents. It can also be used to digitize handwritten text and to recognize text in languages that use non-Latin scripts, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic.<>wiki_csai
