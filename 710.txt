Why do beaches have sand instead of dirt or soil ? Are patches of sand restricted to beaches , deserts and underwater ? If so , why only there ? And if not , then why do those places have so much sand ? Edited for spelling . Explain like I'm five.<>Sand is everywhere . It 's just ground up rocks after all . There 's a lot of rocks and they 've been grinding together for a very long time . Rotting plants make dirt , and in places where it wo n't get washed away the dirt will overwhelm the amount of sand . In places where dirt does n't get laid down , or gets washed or blown away , all that 's left is the sand<>,"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
