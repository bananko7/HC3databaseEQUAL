AND inhibiting the cycle ending and having it build up is pretty common. There are many adjustments of this or a different drug that would be another roll of the dice to see if it worked out better. BUT mostly you'd get the same results every month with the same pill. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
