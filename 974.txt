Please explain what is \"Brain scanning\"<>Neuroimaging is the use of quantitative (computational) techniques to study the structure and function of the central nervous system, developed as an objective way of scientifically studying the healthy human brain in a non-invasive manner. Increasingly it is also being used for quantitative studies of brain disease and psychiatric illness.  Neuroimaging is a highly multidisciplinary research field and is not a medical specialty. \nNeuroimaging differs from neuroradiology which is a medical specialty and uses brain imaging in a clinical setting.  Neuroradiology is practiced by radiologists who are medical practitioners.  Neuroradiology primarily focuses on identifying brain lesions, such as vascular disease, strokes, tumors and inflammatory disease.  In contrast to neuroimaging, neuroradiology is qualitative (based on subjective impressions and extensive clinical training) but sometimes uses basic quantitative methods.  Functional brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are common in neuroimaging but rarely used in neuroradiology.  Neuroimaging falls into two broad categories:<>Brain scanning, also known as brain imaging, is a technique that allows doctors and researchers to visualize the activity and structure of the brain. There are several different types of brain scanning techniques, including:\n\n\n\nComputed Tomography (CT): This technique uses x-rays to create detailed images of the brain.\n\n\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): This technique uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain.\n\n\n\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET): This technique uses a small amount of radioactive material to produce detailed images of the brain's activity.\n\n\n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI): This technique measures blood flow in the brain to identify areas of the brain that are active.\n\n\n\nBrain scanning is often used to diagnose medical conditions, such as brain tumors, strokes, and injuries, as well as to study the brain's function in healthy individuals. It is a non-invasive procedure, which means it does not involve any incisions or injections. However, some brain scanning techniques, such as PET and fMRI, may involve the injection of a small amount of a radioactive tracer or other substance into the bloodstream.<>wiki_csai
