Why are solid state drives so much faster than regular hard drives ? and how exactly do they work ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Imagine you are cooking a pizza and you need the dough , some sauce , and some cheese and they are all located at in different places in a very big kitchen . You could either have Usain Bolt run to each of the places and grab them for you ( spinning disk drive ) or you could have Tom Brady , Peyton Manning , and Aaron Rodgers standing next to each of them and they throw them to you at the same time ( solid state ) . Usain Bolt is fast but not that fast .<>Solid state drives (SSDs) are faster than regular hard drives because they use memory chips to store data, which allows them to access and transfer files much more quickly. Regular hard drives, on the other hand, use spinning disks to store data, which makes them slower at accessing and transferring files. Imagine you have two rooms, each with a bunch of boxes. In one room, the boxes are all stacked neatly in a corner. In the other room, the boxes are scattered all over the place. If you wanted to find a specific box in the first room, it would be much easier and faster than trying to find it in the second room where the boxes are scattered everywhere. Solid state drives work the same way. Because the data is stored neatly in memory chips, the computer can access it quickly. Regular hard drives, on the other hand, have to search through all the data on the spinning disks to find what it is looking for, which takes longer.<>reddit_eli5
