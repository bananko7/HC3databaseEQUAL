Please explain what is \"Optical flow\"<>Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene. Optical flow can also be defined as the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image.\nThe concept of optical flow was introduced by the American psychologist James J. Gibson in the 1940s to describe the visual stimulus provided to animals moving through the world. Gibson stressed the importance of optic flow for affordance perception, the ability to discern possibilities for action within the environment.  Followers of Gibson and his ecological approach to psychology have further demonstrated the role of the optical flow stimulus for the perception of movement by the observer in the world; perception of the shape, distance and movement of objects in the world; and the control of locomotion.\nThe term optical flow is also used by roboticists, encompassing related techniques from image processing and control of navigation including motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-contact information, focus of expansion calculations, luminance, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement.<>Optical flow is a technique used in computer vision to estimate the motion of objects in a video. It involves analyzing the movement of pixels between consecutive frames in a video, and using that information to compute the speed and direction at which those pixels are moving.\n\n\n\nOptical flow algorithms are based on the assumption that pixels in an image that correspond to the same object or surface will move in a similar manner between consecutive frames. By comparing the positions of these pixels in different frames, it is possible to estimate the overall motion of the object or surface.\n\n\n\nOptical flow algorithms are widely used in a variety of applications, including video compression, motion estimation for video processing, and robot navigation. They are also used in computer graphics to create smooth transitions between different video frames, and in autonomous vehicles to track the motion of objects in the environment.<>wiki_csai
