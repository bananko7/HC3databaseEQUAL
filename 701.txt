This is usually temporary and goes away on its own.\n\nSleep disorders: Children may experience leg twitching or shaking due to sleep disorders, such as periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) or sleep-related leg cramps.\n\nOther medical conditions: In rare cases, leg shaking or twitching while lying down may be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as a neurological disorder or muscle disease.\n\nIf your son is experiencing leg shaking or twitching while lying down and it is accompanied by pain, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider.
