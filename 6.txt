Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory form of arthritis that can affect the nails, causing changes in the appearance and texture of the nails. These changes can include pitting, thickening, and yellowing of the nails. It is also common for people with psoriatic arthritis to experience a change in the way their nails grow, such as nails growing more slowly or nails becoming brittle and breaking easily.\n\nIt is important to discuss any changes in your nails with your doctor, as these changes can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. Your doctor can help determine the cause of the changes in your nails and recommend the appropriate treatment. In some cases, treatment for the underlying cause of the nail changes may be necessary. In other cases, treatment for the nail changes may be sufficient.<>medicine
