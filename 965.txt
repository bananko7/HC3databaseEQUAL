If you appoint your cat to fill out your ss disability forms , your car is your attorney in that respect . In contrast , a lawyer is a legal professional ( passed the bar ) who also acts as your attorney .

Lawyers can work in a variety of different fields, such as criminal law, family law, and business law.\r\n\r\nAn attorney is a specific type of lawyer. An attorney is someone who has been licensed to practice law in a particular state or country. Attorneys are authorized to handle legal matters on behalf of their clients and to represent them in court.\r\n\r\nSo, in a way, all attorneys are lawyers, but not all lawyers are attorneys.
