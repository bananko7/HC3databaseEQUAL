Please explain what is \"Active contour model\"<>Active contour model, also called snakes, is a framework in computer vision introduced by Michael Kass, Andrew Witkin, and Demetri Terzopoulos for delineating an object outline from a possibly noisy 2D image. The snakes model is popular in computer vision, and snakes are widely used in applications like object tracking, shape recognition, segmentation, edge detection and stereo matching.\nA snake is an energy minimizing, deformable spline influenced by constraint and image forces that pull it towards object contours and internal forces that resist deformation. Snakes may be understood as a special case of the general technique of matching a deformable model to an image by means of energy minimization. In two dimensions, the active shape model represents a discrete version of this approach, taking advantage of the point distribution model to restrict the shape range to an explicit domain learnt from a training set.\nSnakes do not solve the entire problem of finding contours in images, since the method requires knowledge of the desired contour shape beforehand. Rather, they depend on other mechanisms such as interaction with a user, interaction with some higher level image understanding process, or information from image data adjacent in time or space.<>Active contour model, also known as snakes, is a computer vision technique used to detect and segment an object of interest in an image or video. It is a flexible curve that can be deformed to fit the contours of an object by minimizing an energy functional. The curve is initialized around the object, and then it is iteratively modified to minimize the energy functional, which typically consists of an internal energy term that encourages the curve to have a smooth and regular shape, and an external energy term that drives the curve towards the desired object.\n\n\n\nThe energy functional can be designed to incorporate prior knowledge about the shape and appearance of the object, and can be optimized using optimization techniques such as gradient descent or the Newton-Raphson method. The active contour model can be used to segment a wide range of objects, including objects with complex shapes and those with significant variations in their appearance.\n\n\n\nIn summary, active contour model is a powerful tool for image segmentation that can be used to extract objects of interest from images or videos, and is widely used in many applications, including object tracking, medical image analysis, and object recognition.<>wiki_csai
