What causes chronic pain near last rib after ASD closure?Hello, I have fairly chronic pain below my left breast near my last rib. I noticed it started a year ago when I had ASD closure (percutaneously). I mentioned it to the Interventional Cardiologist who did the procedure but he did not think it was related to the ASD closure. I m female and age 56. I exercise 40 minutes a day and do not smoke or drink.<>Hello,I have gone through your query.Thanks for using HCM.Your pain below left breast is unlikely due to ASD closure.It may be muscular or bone related.If it is not relived with analgesics you should go for investigations like Xray chest,Ultrasound upper abdomen to rule out other causes.My best wishesDr.Rajesh Teli,MD.<>It is possible that the chronic pain you are experiencing near your last rib after ASD closure could be related to the procedure, although it is also possible that it could be caused by something else. Some potential causes of chronic pain near the last rib could include muscle strain or spasm, nerve irritation or entrapment, or inflammation in the area. It is also possible that the pain could be caused by an underlying medical condition, such as a hernia, gastrointestinal issues, or even a rib fracture.\n\nIt is important to speak with a healthcare provider about your chronic pain to determine the cause and receive proper treatment. Your healthcare provider will likely ask you questions about your symptoms, conduct a physical examination, and may recommend additional testing, such as imaging studies or blood tests, to help diagnose the cause of your pain. Treatment options may include medications, physical therapy, and other forms of therapy, depending on the underlying cause of the pain.<>medicine
