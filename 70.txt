Could n't you just get around the Berlin Wall by going to the countryside ? I know this sounds silly but the wall is only so long and surely you could get outside the city in the eastern half and cross elsewhere . Please explain like I'm five.<>The Berlin Wall entirely surrounded West Berlin . It did n't just divide Berlin in two . Berlin was deep inside Eastern Germany .<>The Berlin Wall was a fortified barrier that divided the city of Berlin into two parts: East Berlin, which was controlled by the Soviet Union and its allies, and West Berlin, which was controlled by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The wall was built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing to the West. It was over 155 kilometers (96 miles) long and stretched through the city, separating families, friends, and communities.While it was possible to get around the wall by traveling to the countryside, it was not easy. The wall was guarded by soldiers who were ordered to shoot anyone who tried to cross it without permission. There were also other barriers, such as barbed wire, minefields, and watchtowers, that made it very difficult and dangerous to try to escape.Furthermore, even if someone managed to get past the wall and into the countryside, they would still have to find a way to cross the border into West Germany. This was also heavily guarded and monitored, so it was not a simple task.In short, the Berlin Wall was a very effective barrier that made it extremely difficult for people to escape from East Berlin to the West.<>reddit_eli5
