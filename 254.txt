Please explain what is \"Data dredging\"<>Data dredging (also known as data snooping or p-hacking)[a] is the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant, thus dramatically increasing and understating the risk of false positives. This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.\nThe process of data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using a single data set by exhaustively searchingâ€”perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.\nConventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis).  This level of risk is called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type; hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 5% significance level, 1% might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be reported to be statistically significant (even though this is misleading), since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.\nData dredging is an example of disregarding the multiple comparisons problem. One form is when subgroups are compared without alerting the reader to the total number of subgroup comparisons examined.<>Data dredging, also known as data fishing or p-hacking, refers to the practice of manipulating or analyzing data in a way that gives the appearance of a statistically significant result, when in fact the result is not statistically significant. Data dredging is often done in an effort to find patterns or relationships in data that are not actually present.\n\n\n\nData dredging can occur when researchers are overly flexible in their analysis of the data, and try many different approaches or techniques until they find a result that appears to be statistically significant. This can be a problem because it increases the likelihood of finding false positive results, which can be misleading and can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\n\n\nTo avoid data dredging, researchers should be careful to follow proper statistical practices and should clearly define their research questions and hypotheses before collecting and analyzing data. This helps ensure that the analysis is focused and disciplined, and reduces the risk of finding false positive results.<>wiki_csai
