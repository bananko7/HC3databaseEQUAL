How can fish survive at such incredible depths ? This video popped the question into my head . URL_0 Explain like I'm five.<>Imagine a hollow sphere , made of glass , with a vacuum inside . Out in space , a vacuum , it would n't break under the pressure . Then imagine it in Earth 's atmosphere , where it would obviously implode . But you and I are n't imploding , correct ? If the internal pressure is equal to the external pressure , it wo n't explode or implode , regardless of the magnitude of the pressures involved .<>Fish are able to survive at incredible depths because they have adapted to the unique conditions found in the deep sea. Some of the adaptations that allow fish to survive at these depths include:\r\n\r\nPressure tolerance: The pressure at great depths is much higher than at the surface, and fish have evolved to withstand this pressure. Some fish, like the Mariana snailfish, can even survive at depths of over 8,000 meters (26,000 feet)!\r\n\r\nCold tolerance: The deep sea is also very cold, and some fish have adapted to survive in these frigid temperatures. For example, the Antarctic toothfish has a special enzyme that helps it survive in the freezing waters of the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nLow light levels: There is very little light at great depths, and many deep-sea fish have adapted to this by having large eyes or by being able to see in the dark using special light-sensing organs called photophores.\r\n\r\nLack of oxygen: The deep sea can also have low levels of oxygen, and some fish have adapted to this by having larger gills or by being able to extract more oxygen from the water.\r\n\r\nOverall, fish that live at great depths have evolved a variety of adaptations that allow them to survive in these extreme conditions.<>reddit_eli5
