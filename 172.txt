Can a dealer keep my deposit (on a non-existant car) if my loan is not approved?<>Without the contract it's hard to say for sure, but Consumer Reports indicates that it's pretty easy to lose these deposits; they're not as well protected as other deposits or purchases (depending on your state and other details).  You should make an effort to comply with all of the requests from the financing arm promptly, and in particular you should probably highlight that you could afford to pay for the car in cash (and be prepared to show bank\/money market\/investment statements to back that up).  Credit is mostly a numbers game, but there is a human on the other side making the decision (assuming you're remotely close) and that makes a big difference.   I would be prepared to walk away from your deposit if they come back and offer you a 5% APR or similar (and you're uncomfortable with the loan at that rate) - over 5 years, a $20k loan at 5% APR will cost you several thousand dollars; it might be worth it even if they don't give you your deposit back.  And if you're clearly ready to walk away from the deposit, that might cause them to negotiate in better faith. Some tips, both from that article and my general experience:<>It is generally not appropriate for a dealer to keep a deposit if a loan is not approved and the sale does not go through. The dealer may ask for a deposit as a good faith gesture or to hold a vehicle while the loan is being processed, but if the loan is not approved and the sale does not proceed, the dealer should return the deposit to the customer. If the dealer is unwilling to return the deposit, the customer may want to seek legal advice or file a complaint with their state's attorney general or consumer protection agency.<>finance
