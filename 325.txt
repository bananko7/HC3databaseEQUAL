Explain like I'm five.<>Depression can hit anyone , anywhere , in any situation . It can be triggered by a situation or it can simply be a chemical imbalance .<>Depression is a complex mental health condition that can be caused by a variety of factors. It is not uncommon for people with depression to come from \"good\" or safe backgrounds. It is also not uncommon for people who have experienced difficult or traumatic events to be able to cope with these challenges and not develop depression.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that everyone is different and people cope with adversity in different ways. Just because someone seems to be handling a difficult situation well, does not mean that they are not struggling emotionally. Similarly, just because someone comes from a privileged background does not mean that they are immune to mental health challenges.\r\n\r\nIt is important to be understanding and supportive of anyone who is struggling with depression, no matter what their background may be.<>reddit_eli5
