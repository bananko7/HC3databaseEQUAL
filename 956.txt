Suggest treatment to increase the heightHello I have a 7 yr old girl Brook my Doc said that she is at the height she should be for her age, but I dont think so other kids in her school her age are taller. Is there something wrong with her bones? and I can i give her something to help her grow better and faster?<>Hi, If the doctors who examined her told you not to worry means she is in the right growth velocity. No need to worry. growth will occur up to 18 years so no need to worry. You can give protein-rich food to help her grow. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Rajmohan, Pediatrician<>It is normal for children to grow at different rates, and it is not uncommon for children to have periods of faster or slower growth. It is important to remember that genetics play a significant role in a child's height, so it is possible that your daughter's height is within the normal range for her genetic potential.\n\nIt is not advisable to try to increase your child's height through medical intervention or supplements, as this can have negative effects on their overall health and development. Children should be allowed to grow at their own natural pace, and it is important to focus on providing a healthy diet and lifestyle to support their growth and development.\n\nIf you have concerns about your child's growth, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional. They can assess your child's growth and development and provide guidance on how to support their health and well-being.<>medicine
