Pain in lower back. Problem with kidneys?Hi, I have been having sharp pains in my left side, lower back. To be honest it feels like someone is taking a small sharp object like a needle and poking me every few minutes. Its tolerable, I m not to the point where I need to cry over it, I just would like to know why its doing this and if I should be worried? Is it my kidneys? Could something be wrong with them?<>HiThank you for your question to HCM.Pain in the lower back on either side can come from multiple reasons that lead to paraspinal muscle spasm or from inner organs. Pain related to kidneys is usually felt in the 'subcostal angle' which is just below the rib cage and on one side of the midline in back. A tenderness elicited by pressing deep in this region would indicate kidneys as a likely cause. In your case it would be helpful to know your age, how long the pain has been there, was there any inciting event that started this pain and are there any related symptoms like fever or any urinary symptoms. I would recommend if the pain persists for a long time or symptoms worsen, you will need to see a doctor to find out the cause of your pain.Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.<>It is possible that the pain you are experiencing could be related to your kidneys, as the kidneys are located in the lower back area. However, there are many other potential causes of lower back pain, and it is important to get a proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional in order to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nKidney pain is usually felt as a dull ache on one side of the lower back, and it can range from mild to severe. It is often accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, urinary problems, and abdominal pain.\n\nThere are several conditions that can cause kidney pain, including kidney stones, kidney infections, and kidney inflammation. If you are experiencing kidney pain, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try over-the-counter pain medication and applying heat to the affected area to help alleviate the discomfort. It is also important to drink plenty of fluids, as this can help flush out any kidney stones that may be causing the pain.\n\nAgain, it is important to see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.<>medicine
