It is important that you see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\n\nThere are many potential causes of a lump above the knee, some of which may be benign (non-cancerous) and others that may be more serious. Possible causes of a lump above the knee include:\n\nBursitis: This is inflammation of a bursa, which are small fluid-filled sacs that act as cushions between bones and soft tissues. Bursitis can cause a painful lump to develop above the knee.\n\nCellulitis: This is a bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues that can cause a red, swollen, and tender area to develop above the knee.\n\nGanglion cyst: This is a benign (non-cancerous) cyst that develops from the joint or a tendon sheath. It can cause a small, round lump to form above the knee.\n\nLipoma: This is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor made up of fat cells. It can cause a soft, movable lump to form above the knee.\n\nSoft tissue sarcoma: This is a type of cancer that can develop in the muscles, fat, blood vessels, or other soft tissues of the body. It can cause a hard, painless lump to form above the knee.\n\nAgain, it is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They will be able to determine the cause of the lump and recommend appropriate treatment.","It is not possible for me to diagnose the cause of a lump or any other medical issue without examining the individual and obtaining a complete medical history. It is important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation and proper diagnosis. There are many potential causes for a lump above the knee, including a cyst, a lipoma (a benign fatty tumor), a hematoma (a collection of blood outside of a blood vessel), or a muscle strain or injury. It is important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you should avoid activities that cause discomfort or pain, and try to keep the affected area elevated and supported to help reduce swelling.","It's difficult to accurately diagnose a lump without examining it in person or reviewing additional information such as medical history and imaging tests. Lumps can be caused by a variety of factors including injury, inflammation, or underlying medical conditions. Some possible causes of a lump above the knee include:\n\nBursitis: This is a condition in which the bursae (small fluid-filled sacs that act as cushions between bones and soft tissues) become inflamed. Bursitis can be caused by repetitive stress or injury to the knee.\n\nCysts: Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in various locations in the body. They may be caused by injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions.\n\nFatty tumors (lipomas): These are benign (non-cancerous) growths that occur when fat cells grow in an abnormal way. Lipomas are typically slow-growing and painless.\n\nBaker's cyst: Also called a popliteal cyst, this is a fluid-filled swelling that occurs behind the knee. It is often caused by inflammation or injury to the knee joint.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor if you have a lump that is causing pain or discomfort, or if the lump has changed in size, shape, or appearance. The doctor will examine the lump and may order additional tests, such as imaging studies or a biopsy, to determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment.<>medicine
