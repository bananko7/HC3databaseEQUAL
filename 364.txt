Please explain what is \"Graphical model\"<>A graphical model or probabilistic graphical model (PGM) or structured probabilistic model is a probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence structure between random variables. They are commonly used in probability theory, statistics—particularly Bayesian statistics—and machine learning.<>A graphical model is a probabilistic model for representing the relationships between variables in a graph. Each variable is represented as a node in the graph, and the edges between the nodes represent the relationships between the variables. The graph encodes a set of conditional independencies between the variables, which means that the probability distribution of the variables can be represented compactly by only specifying the values of the variables that are directly connected by edges in the graph.\n\n\n\nGraphical models are used to represent and reason about complex systems in which the relationships between the variables are uncertain or hard to quantify. They are a useful tool for modeling and analyzing data, particularly in the fields of machine learning, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of graphical models: directed graphical models, also known as Bayesian networks, and undirected graphical models, also known as Markov random fields. In a directed graphical model, the edges in the graph represent a causal relationship between the variables, while in an undirected graphical model, the edges represent a statistical relationship between the variables.\n\n\n\nGraphical models provide a powerful framework for representing and reasoning about complex systems, and have been applied to a wide range of problems, including speech recognition, image classification, natural language processing, and many others.<>wiki_csai
