Should I finance a new home theater at 0% even though I have the cash for it?<>Read the fine print and you will be fine.  The big caveat is that if you miss a payment for any reason, you will be in default as far as the promotional financing is concerned and will typically owe ALL of the accrued interest, which is usually computed at 20-25% per year. Personally, I use these sorts of offers all of the time at places like Home Depot for stuff that doesn't generally need warranty service. (Wood, tools, etc) Usually I pay the thing off over time as CDs mature. If I'm buying a TV, computer, etc. I always use my AMEX, because I get an extra year of warranty service and points for free.<>It's ultimately up to you and your personal financial situation whether or not financing a home theater at 0% interest is a good idea, even if you have the cash to pay for it outright. Here are a few things to consider:Opportunity cost: If you pay for the home theater in cash, you'll no longer have that money available to invest or use for other purposes. Consider whether you could potentially earn a higher return on your money by investing it elsewhere rather than using it to pay for the home theater.Emergency funds: It's generally a good idea to have an emergency fund that you can tap into in case of unexpected expenses. If you use your cash to pay for the home theater, you may have less available for emergencies.Future expenses: If you finance the home theater at 0% interest, you'll have the flexibility to use your cash for other expenses that may come up in the future.Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to finance a home theater at 0% interest or pay for it in cash should be based on your individual financial situation and priorities. It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or create a budget to help you make a decision that's right for you.<>finance
