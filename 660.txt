Neon Genesis : Evangelion I 've watched the series twice now , and have been watching the follow up movies and I am still really confused . Any ideas ? Explain like I'm five.<>* Ancient alien race created seeds of life , and sent them across the universe to spread life . * Billions of years ago , the White Moon , with Adam crashes on Earth , and Adam begins it 's purpose of creating angels . The Angel 's 3 through 17 are the children of Adam . * By accident the Black Moon crashed on Earth carrying Lillith , another the seed of life . * Only one seed of life can exist on a planet , The spear of longinus is a fail - safe that will kill it 's seed of life if it comes in contact with the other . ( Not so much kill , but rather just putting it in indefinate suspended animation ) * Lillith 's spear was destroyed on impact , forcing Adam 's spear to activate and neutralize Adam . * Lillith began spreading life forms known as Lillim , better known as Humans . * Second Impact was initiated by Human contact on the suspended Adam . Adam 's embryo was recovered . * NERV is a secret military organization contracted by the UN . The purpose of NERV is to clone the DNA of Adam , to create Bio - mechanical giant robot 's , known as the EVA 's . * Lillith 's DNA is also cloned into an EVA . EVA-01 * NERV HQ is built directly ontop of the Black Moon and Lillith , holding them in a top secret underground vault known as Terminal Dogma . * LCL is a liquid that is described as the primordial soup of life , it is used in the Eva 's as a medium to assist the fusion of the Eva pilot and the Eva . * SEELE is a top secret government councel , like the Illuminati . They plan the Human instrumentality project , which would make all souls on earth one entity , and give them godlike powers . * Shinji 's mother worked at NERV with Gendo , and she must have known about SEELE 's goals , and she sacrificed herself in another contact experiment , and fused her soul with the physical form of the cloned lillith . * 15 years after the second impact , the children of Adam begin attacking NERV in attempts to reach Lillith , cause the 3rd impact , and reclaim the Earth for Adam . * 14 different Angel 's attack , each one different than the one previous . As each angel is defeated , it is shown that they are similar to humans , and learn that they were failed prototypes of life before Humans . * Each Angel has an AT - field . It act 's as a force field , or a weapon , but it is also related to the soul , ego , and individualism in humans . * EVA 01 consumes an angel 's S2 engine , which is essentially the heart and brain of an angel . The merger of EVA 01 and the S2 engine completes the transformation of the Eva from a clone , into a true equal of Adam and Lillith . * Gendo fuses the Adam embryo into his palm , and plans to fuse it with Lillith , to create the forbidden fusion , and kick start the Human instrumentality project , and use it 's godlike powers for his own means of being reunited with his dead wife . * After defended all the attacks from the angels , SEELE raids NERV to begin the Human Instrumentality project . Human 's are the final angel . * Gendo succeed 's in fusing Adam and Lillith . This new entity has the power of anti AT - fields , which negates any AT - field , and reduces all life back LCL , the primordial soup , the most basic lifeform . This is life becoming one being again . * Eva-02 is fighting the mass produced Eva series , while Shinji is too afraid to pilot Eva-01 and help . * When Shinji does show up , he goes berserk seeing EVA-02 dead . This triggers the spear of longinious , and it redirects it 's course from outerspace back to Earth ( it was used to kill an angel in orbit earlier . ) * The spear , combined with EVA-01 created the tree of life . The tree of life creates a world wide anti - AT field , leaving the entire population vulnerable to Lillith . * Lillith collects all the souls , and begins to merge with them , and the tree of life containing EVA-01 and shinji . * Shinji is the final soul to merge with Lillith , therefore he gets the final decision of what is to become of all these souls . * Is it better to accept instrumentality , and live as one single entity ? Free from the hate , sadness , pain , loneliness and other negatives of the world . * Is it better to live as yourself , and accept the bad with the good ? * The series ending can be confusing . Some people could interpret the final scenes as Shinji finally overcoming his porcupine dilemma ( he is afraid of love because he may get emotionally hurt ) , and living a fulfilling life due to confidence and loving friends and family . However , other 's argue that Shinji actually chose to accept instrumentality , and is living in a dream world , since everyone was nice to him , and he enjoyed a pleasant day at school . It 's almost impossible to determine for sure , but I think there are subtle hints that point that he rejected it . * The final scene of End of Evangelion shows something entirely different . URL_0 . * Asuka returns to life , and comments \" How disgusting \" when she sees Shinji crying over her , and the results of his decision . Can we assume that Asuka was hoping that Shinji would choose to accept instrumentality , to end the pain she has hidden since her mother 's suicide ? This would complete both characters transformation from being a scared coward , and a fearless bitch , to a loving friend and a depressed girl . * How the rebuild series relates to the original series , I 'm not totally sure . It can be a retelling set in an alternate universe .. It could be the effects of Shinji 's decision , ( doomed to repeat the past ) , or it<>Neon Genesis Evangelion is a complex and psychological anime series that explores themes of identity, relationships, and the human condition. It follows the story of a teenage boy named Shinji, who is recruited by his father to pilot a giant bio-machine called an \"Evangelion\" to fight mysterious creatures called Angels that are threatening to destroy humanity. As Shinji struggles to come to terms with his role as a pilot and his relationships with other characters, he must also grapple with deep personal issues, such as feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. The series is known for its dense and symbolic storytelling, which can be difficult to fully understand on a single viewing. One key aspect of the series that may be confusing is the concept of the \"Inner Sphere,\" which represents the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters. The series often uses surreal imagery and symbolism to depict the Inner Sphere and explore the psychological states of the characters. Another aspect that may be confusing is the role of the Angels, who are depicted as both enemies and symbols of personal growth. The Angels represent various aspects of the human psyche and often represent the characters' inner conflicts and desires. Overall, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a highly complex and thought-provoking series that explores deep and philosophical themes. If you're having trouble understanding it, you may want to consider re-watching it or looking up more information online to get a better understanding of the series.<>reddit_eli5
