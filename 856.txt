Everyone keeps telling me to NOT give it to him when he is going to be overheated... Well thats everyday!! Please Help Me ??<>Hi, Vyvanse drug is mostly used in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or binge eating disorder. In my opinion, If your child is taking drug in proper dosage then there is nothing to worry. However, you should keep a watch on symptoms like restlessness, muscle cramp or spasms. If these symptoms present then dose needs to be decreased or stopped. I hope this has helped you. Wishing your child good health. Take care.<>It is generally safe to give Vyvanse to children who are active in sports. Vyvanse is a stimulant medication that is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can help improve focus and attention, which can be beneficial for children participating in sports.\n\nHowever, it is important to follow the dosing instructions provided by your child's healthcare provider and to monitor your child for any adverse effects. Some people may experience side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure when taking stimulant medications. This could potentially be a concern for children participating in sports, especially if they are already overheated.\n\nIt is also important to note that Vyvanse is a controlled substance and is classified as a schedule II drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. This means that it has a high potential for abuse and can be habit-forming. As a result, it is important to use Vyvanse as directed and to keep it out of the reach of children.\n\nIf you have any concerns about giving Vyvanse to your child while he is participating in sports, you should talk to his healthcare provider. They can provide more specific guidance based on your child's individual needs and medical history.<>medicine
