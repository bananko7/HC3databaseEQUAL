Q. Can having Cymbalta lead to no sexual drive in a patient with fibromyalgia?Hi doctor,My girlfriend has fibromyalgia and is currently on Cymbalta and a muscle relaxant. She said she has no desire for sex but it seems she is having sexual dreams. She does not know that she is doing it but it does not make sense to me. When she was on Tramadol, everything was fine unless she was just high from that drug. Any insight from you would be helpful. Thank you.<>Hello. For further information consult a rheumatologist online --> https:\/\/www.icliniq.com\/ask-a-doctor-online\/rheumatologist<>Cymbalta (duloxetine) is a medication that is commonly used to treat fibromyalgia and other conditions, such as depression and anxiety. It is known to have some potential side effects, including a decrease in sexual desire or ability. This side effect can be more common in people who are taking high doses of the medication, but it can also occur in people taking lower doses. If your girlfriend is experiencing a decrease in sexual desire or ability while taking Cymbalta, it is important to talk to her healthcare provider about it. The provider may be able to adjust the dosage or suggest an alternative treatment.\n\nIt is also worth noting that fibromyalgia itself can cause a decrease in sexual desire or ability, and this could be contributing to your girlfriend's symptoms. Other factors, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, can also affect sexual desire and function. It is important to discuss any concerns about sexual desire or function with a healthcare provider, as they can help identify the underlying cause and suggest appropriate treatment options.<>medicine
