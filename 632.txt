Using Marine Traffic (AIS) to make stock picks?<>You can. Speculating on marine traffic is more closely tied to oil trades and ocean shipping container rates, than trades on any particular companies. But companies heavily tied to ocean shipping can be ripe for speculation. The baltic dry index is created for this analytical purpose, and that information can be used as an indicator to hedge or speculate in container freight swap agreements.  The Guggenheim Shipping Exchange Traded Fund also serves as a proxy for maritime shipping profitability, but it is just a bundle of several publicly traded marine shipping companies shares.<>It is possible to use data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to inform investment decisions, as AIS data can provide insights into the movement and utilization of vessels in the shipping industry. However, it is important to note that AIS data should be considered in conjunction with other sources of information and should not be relied upon solely for making investment decisions.AIS is a maritime navigation safety system that uses transponders on ships to transmit their location, speed, and heading to other vessels and to shore-based systems. AIS data is collected and made available by organizations such as Marine Traffic, which provides a platform for viewing real-time and historical AIS data.One potential way to use AIS data in stock picking is to analyze the activity of vessels belonging to companies in the shipping industry, as this can provide insight into the demand for their services and the utilization of their assets. For example, if a shipping company's vessels are frequently in use and traveling to a diverse range of ports, this could be a positive sign for the company's financial performance.However, it is important to note that AIS data should be considered in the context of other relevant factors, such as economic conditions, industry trends, and the company's financial performance. It is also important to be aware of the limitations of AIS data, as it only provides information about the movement of vessels that are equipped with AIS transponders, and does not include all vessels on the water.<>finance
