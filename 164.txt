Please explain what is \"Symbolic computation\"<>In mathematics and computer science, computer algebra, also called symbolic computation or algebraic computation, is a scientific area that refers to the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathematical objects. Although computer algebra could be considered a subfield of scientific computing, they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on numerical computation with approximate floating point numbers, while symbolic computation emphasizes exact computation with expressions containing variables that have no given value and are manipulated as symbols.\nSoftware applications that perform symbolic calculations are called computer algebra systems, with the term system alluding to the complexity of the main applications  that include, at least, a method to represent mathematical data in a computer, a user programming language (usually different from the language used for the implementation), a dedicated memory manager, a user interface for the input\/output of mathematical expressions, a large set of routines to perform usual operations, like simplification of expressions, differentiation using chain rule, polynomial factorization, indefinite integration, etc.\nComputer algebra is widely used to experiment in mathematics and to design the formulas that are used in numerical programs. It is also used for complete scientific computations, when purely numerical methods fail, as in public key cryptography, or for some non-linear problems.<>Symbolic computation, also known as symbolic algebra or algebraic manipulation, is a branch of mathematics in which algebraic expressions and equations are manipulated and simplified using symbolic techniques. This approach to computation is based on the use of symbols, rather than numerical values, to represent mathematical quantities and operations.\n\n\n\nSymbolic computation can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in mathematics, including algebraic equations, differential equations, and integral equations. It can also be used to perform operations on polynomials, matrices, and other types of mathematical objects.\n\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of symbolic computation is that it can often provide more insight into the structure of a problem and the relationships between different quantities than numerical techniques can. This can be particularly useful in areas of mathematics that involve complex or abstract concepts, where it can be difficult to understand the underlying structure of the problem using numerical techniques alone.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of software programs and programming languages that are specifically designed for symbolic computation, such as Mathematica, Maple, and Maxima. These tools allow users to input algebraic expressions and equations and manipulate them symbolically to find solutions or simplify them.<>wiki_csai
