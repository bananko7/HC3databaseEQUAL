Please explain what is \"General game playing\"<>General game playing (GGP) is the design of artificial intelligence programs to be able to play more than one game successfully. For many games like chess, computers are programmed to play these games using a specially designed algorithm, which cannot be transferred to another context. For instance, a chess-playing computer program cannot play checkers. General game playing is considered as a necessary milestone on the way to artificial general intelligence.\nGeneral video game playing  (GVGP) is the concept of GGP adjusted to the purpose of playing video games. For video games, game rules have to be either learnt over multiple iterations by artificial players like TD-Gammon, or are predefined manually in a domain-specific language and sent in advance to artificial players like in traditional GGP. Starting in 2013, significant progress was made following the deep reinforcement learning approach, including the development of programs that can learn to play Atari 2600 games[10][11] as well as a program that can learn to play Nintendo Entertainment System games.[12][13][14]\nThe first commercial usage of general game playing technology was Zillions of Games in 1998. General game playing was also proposed for trading agents in supply chain management thereunder price negotiation in online auctions from 2003 on.[15][16][17][18]<>General game playing (GGP) is a research field in artificial intelligence that focuses on the creation of computer programs that can autonomously play a wide variety of games. The goal of GGP is to build a single program that can play any game, without being specifically designed for any particular game.\n\n\n\nGGP systems typically consist of two main components: a game description language and a general game-playing agent. The game description language is a formal language that is used to describe the rules of a game. It specifies the actions that players can take, the state of the game, and the conditions for winning or losing. The general game-playing agent is a program that uses the game description to reason about the current state of the game, evaluate potential moves, and make decisions.\n\n\n\nGGP systems have been used to play a variety of games, including board games, card games, and video games. They have also been used to study decision-making and strategic reasoning in a variety of contexts, including economics, politics, and military strategy.<>wiki_csai
