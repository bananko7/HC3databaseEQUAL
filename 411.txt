Is chest pain related to intake of clindamycin and oxycodone?Hi Dr. Bhatti, I was recently released from the hospital after a hand surgery and they provided me with Clindamycin 300mg and Oxycodone Acetaminophens. Ive taken this combination 3 times now and my chest feels really tight. Is there reason for me to worry?<>Hello, The use of Clindamycin can cause stomach pain or a hyperacidity of the stomach. So, I recommend using a medication to lower the acidity production such as Omeprazole daily. I also suggest using Maalox three times a day and avoid food that can trigger the symptoms such as spicy food. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. Dorina Gurabardhi, General & Family Physician<>It is possible that chest pain could be related to the use of Clindamycin and Oxycodone. However, it is also important to consider other potential causes of chest pain, such as heart problems or other underlying health conditions. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider if you are experiencing chest pain, as this could be a serious issue that requires medical attention. In the meantime, you should follow the instructions of your healthcare provider and report any adverse effects to them. If you are experiencing difficulty breathing or severe chest pain, you should seek immediate medical attention.<>medicine
