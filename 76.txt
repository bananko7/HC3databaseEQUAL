You can explain at that time about this hurting the head on walls. If felt necessary, a CT scan brain might be done to rule out and injury in the head.Hope this helps.<>I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you are facing with your husband. It is important to seek professional help for your husband's behavior and the blood clots in his brain. It is not appropriate or safe for you to try to handle this situation on your own.\n\nYour husband may be experiencing a mental health issue, such as anger management problems or a mood disorder, that is causing him to act out in this way. It is important for him to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment from a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist.\n\nIn addition, the blood clots in your husband's brain could be a serious medical condition that requires prompt attention. It is important for him to see a doctor as soon as possible to determine the cause of the blood clots and to receive appropriate treatment.\n\nI recommend that you encourage your husband to seek help from a qualified medical or mental health professional as soon as possible. You may also want to consider reaching out to a support group or seeking counseling for yourself to help you cope with the challenges you are facing.<>medicine
