I would recommend using vitamin B6 and B12 for pins and needle sensations in hands and feet. Also dipping the hands and feet in taped water followed by application of vaseline also helps. Encourage him to eat and drink for improving his lost strength. Also repeat complete blood counts to rule out any abnormality in blood cells. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.<>I'm sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis and the challenges he is facing. Stomach cancer is a serious and complex disease, and treatment options can vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case. It's important to discuss your father's treatment options with his medical team, who will be able to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information and guidance based on his specific condition and needs.\n\nThere are several different approaches that may be considered as part of the treatment for stomach cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In some cases, a combination of these treatments may be recommended. The goal of treatment is to try to remove or destroy the cancer cells as completely as possible, while minimizing any negative side effects.\n\nAfter completing radiation therapy, it's not uncommon for people to experience fatigue and other side effects, such as the loss of strength and feeling in their arms and legs. It's important to talk to your father's medical team about any symptoms he is experiencing, as they can provide guidance on how to manage these side effects and help him feel more comfortable.\n\nIn addition to medical treatment, there are also other supportive measures that can be helpful for people with stomach cancer, such as dietary changes, physical therapy, and other forms of rehabilitation. It's important to work closely with your father's medical team to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for his specific situation.<>medicine
