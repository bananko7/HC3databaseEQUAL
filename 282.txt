Do shares purchased on FTSE AIM move with company to other markets?<>Any shares you buy when a company is listed on one market will remain yours if the company moves to another market. Markets and exchanges like AIM are just venues for dealing in shares - indeed you can deal in those shares anywhere else that will allow you as well as on the AIM. The benefit of being listed in a market is that trade in the shares will be more \"liquid\" - there's more likely to be people who want to buy and sell them at any given time. The bigger concern would be what happens if the company does badly and drops out of the AIM entirely. You'd still be able to sell your shares to any willing buyer, but finding that buyer might get harder.<>Yes, shares purchased on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) will move with the company if it decides to list its shares on another market. For example, if a company listed on AIM decides to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange's main market, the shares will be transferred from AIM to the main market and will continue to be traded there. Investors who hold shares in the company will still own those shares and will be able to trade them on the new market.It's worth noting that the process of moving a company's shares from one market to another can be complex and may involve certain procedures and fees. If you own shares in a company that is considering moving to another market, you may want to seek the advice of a financial professional to help you understand the implications of the move for your investment.<>finance
