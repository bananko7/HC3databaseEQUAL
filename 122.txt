How do I handle taxes on a very large “gift” from my employers?<>You should be aware that the IRS considers all gifts of cash or cash equivalents from an employer (the partnership in this case) to an employee (your husband in this case) to be wages, regardless of what the transfer is called by either party, or how it is transferred. I'd strongly recommend that you review IRS publications 535 and 15-B, which are linked in my response to the question that littleadv referred to above. I would also recommend speaking with a lawyer, as in this case, you have knowledge of the income and would not be able to claim an \"innocent spouse\" provision if he is convicted of tax evasion\/fraud. Good luck.<>It is generally not necessary to pay taxes on gifts that you receive from your employer. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.If the gift is considered to be compensation for your services, then it may be taxable as income. For example, if you receive a gift of stock as a bonus for meeting certain performance targets, that stock would be considered taxable income.If the gift is not considered to be compensation, it may still be subject to taxes if it exceeds the annual gift tax exclusion amount, which is currently $15,000 per recipient per year. If the value of the gift exceeds this amount, you may need to file a gift tax return and pay taxes on the excess amount.It is a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to the IRS guidelines for more information on how to handle taxes on gifts from your employer.<>finance
