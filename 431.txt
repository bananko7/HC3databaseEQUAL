Invisalign is a popular orthodontic treatment that uses clear, removable aligners to gradually move the teeth into proper alignment. The aligners apply gentle pressure to the teeth to move them gradually into the desired position. Invisalign can be effective for a wide range of alignment issues, including crowding, spacing, and misalignment.\n\nIf you are experiencing difficulty with your front teeth not touching because of the gums or muscle between them, your orthodontist or dental professional may be able to use a variety of techniques to address this issue. One option might be to use special aligners that apply more pressure to the specific teeth that are not aligning properly. Alternatively, your orthodontist may recommend additional treatment methods, such as the use of rubber bands or special appliances, to help move the teeth into the desired position.\n\nIt is important to note that any orthodontic treatment, including Invisalign, should be carefully planned and supervised by a trained dental professional. Your orthodontist or dental professional will be able to assess your specific situation and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan for your needs.<>medicine
