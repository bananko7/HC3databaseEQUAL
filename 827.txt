How can I work out how much a side-job contracting will be taxed for?<>Being self-employed, your \"profit\" is calculated as all the bills you send out, minus all business-related cost that you have (you will need a receipt for everything, and there are different rules for things that last for long time, long tools, machinery).  You can file your taxes yourself - the HRS website will tell you how to, and you can do it online. It's close to the same as your normal online tax return. Only thing is that you must keep receipts for all the cost that you claim.  Your tax: Assuming your gross salary is £25,000 and your profits are about £10,000, you will be paying 8% for national insurance, and 20% income tax. If you go above £43,000 or thereabouts, you pay 40% income tax on any income above that threshold, instead of 20%, but your national insurance payments stop.<>To determine how much tax you will pay on income from a side job as a contractor, you will need to consider several factors, including your tax filing status, your total taxable income, and the tax rate that applies to your income.In the United States, tax rates are typically progressive, which means that higher income is taxed at a higher rate. However, the specific tax rate that applies to your income will depend on your tax filing status and your taxable income.To calculate your tax liability, you will first need to determine your total taxable income. This is your total income from your side job as a contractor, minus any deductions and exemptions that you are eligible for.Next, you will need to determine your tax filing status. Your tax filing status is based on your marital status and whether you have any dependents. The five tax filing statuses are single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household, and qualifying widow(er) with dependent child.Once you know your taxable income and your tax filing status, you can use a tax calculator or refer to the tax tables published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine your tax liability.It's important to note that as a contractor, you may be required to make estimated tax payments throughout the year rather than paying all of your tax liability in a lump sum when you file your tax return. This is because as a contractor, you may not have taxes withheld from your pay in the same way that an employee does. The IRS provides guidance on how to make estimated tax payments and how to determine whether you are required to do so.It's also worth noting that as a contractor, you may be responsible for paying self-employment tax in addition to income tax. Self-employment tax is a tax that covers your Medicare and Social Security contributions and is calculated based on your net self-employment income.I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions or would like more detailed guidance on calculating your tax liability as a contractor, I recommend consulting a tax professional or the IRS website.<>finance
