Why is there such a wide gap in the intelligence of homo sapiens and every other organism ? The answer I 've been given was basically : GOD . I 'm not convinced ..... Please explain like I'm five.<>Chimpanzees are actually pretty close to us . But here 's the thing . Once we reached a certain level of intelligence , we adopted a way of life centered around intelligence -- notably the use of language , tools , and complex civilizations . Suddenly being intelligent was * even more valuable * because our societies were designed around it . Once society started rewarding intelligence , people with higher intelligence were * even more likely * to survive and reproduce . A self - reinforcing cycle was born .<>There are many factors that contribute to the wide gap in intelligence between humans and other organisms. One of the main factors is evolution. Humans have evolved over time to have a highly developed brain and nervous system that allows us to think, reason, communicate, and solve problems. This has allowed us to adapt to a wide range of environments and to develop complex societies and technologies.Another factor that may contribute to the gap in intelligence is the size of the brain. Humans have relatively large brains compared to other animals, and this may have helped us to evolve higher levels of intelligence. Additionally, the human brain is structured in a way that allows for a high level of flexibility and adaptability, which may also contribute to our ability to learn and solve problems.It's also worth noting that intelligence is not the same thing as consciousness, and there are many other animals that are able to exhibit complex behaviors and problem-solving abilities, even if they don't have the same level of intelligence as humans.<>reddit_eli5
