First Time Home Buyers - Down Payment, PMI and Points<>The question Why would refinancing my mortgage increase my PMI, even though rates are lower? contains a decent discussion of PMI. It's based on the total amount you borrow, not just the difference to 80% LTV.  For easy math, Say you put 15% down on a $100K house. Your PMI is 1.1%, not on the 'missing' $5000, but on the $85000 balance. So you are paying $935\/yr extra due to the $5000 you didn't have available. In addition to the mortgage itself. Even at 90% LTV, you'd pay $990\/yr for the fact that you are short $10,000.  Other than this discussion of PMI calculations, Chad's answer is pretty thorough.<>Purchasing a home is a significant financial commitment, and it can be intimidating for first-time home buyers who may not be familiar with all the terms and options involved. Here is a brief overview of some key concepts that you may encounter when buying a home:Down payment: A down payment is the amount of money that you put towards the purchase of a home. It is typically expressed as a percentage of the home's purchase price. For example, if you are buying a home for $200,000 and you put down 20%, your down payment would be $40,000. Down payments are typically required for most types of mortgage loans, and the size of your down payment can affect the terms of your mortgage.Private mortgage insurance (PMI): PMI is a type of insurance that is often required for home buyers who make a down payment of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. PMI protects the lender in the event that you default on your mortgage payments. The cost of PMI is typically added to your monthly mortgage payments, and it can be removed once you have built up enough equity in your home.Points: Points are a type of fee that you may be required to pay at closing when you take out a mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the mortgage loan amount. Points are typically used to buy down the interest rate on a mortgage, which can lower your monthly payments. However, the decision to pay points is a trade-off, as you may pay more up front in exchange for lower monthly payments over the life of the loan.It's important to carefully consider all of these factors when buying a home, and to consult with a financial professional to determine the best options for your specific situation.","As a first-time home buyer, you may have a lot of questions about the process of purchasing a home, including how much money you will need to put down as a down payment and what types of mortgage insurance or points you may need to pay. Here is some information that can help:Down Payment:The down payment is the amount of money that you put towards the purchase of your home. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the total purchase price. Most lenders require a down payment of at least 3% of the purchase price, although some may require a higher percentage. In some cases, you may be able to qualify for a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 3.5% if you meet certain criteria, such as being a first-time homebuyer or being a veteran.Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of insurance that protects the lender in case you default on your mortgage. It is required if you put down less than 20% of the purchase price as a down payment. PMI is typically paid as a monthly premium, and the cost is based on the size of your mortgage and the amount of your down payment.Points:Points are fees that you pay to the lender at closing in exchange for a lower interest rate on your mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. For example, if you are taking out a $200,000 mortgage and you pay two points, you will pay $4,000 in points at closing. Points can be a good option if you plan to stay in your home for a long time and you want to save on interest payments over the life of the loan. However, they may not make sense if you plan to sell the home or refinance within a few years, as you may not recoup the cost of the points.It's important to consider all of these factors when deciding how much to put down as a down payment and whether to pay points or PMI. You should also talk to a lender or a mortgage broker to get more information about your options and to determine what makes the most sense for your situation.<>finance
