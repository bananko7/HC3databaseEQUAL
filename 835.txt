if i was being chased by a bear , could i just find a tree with a decently sized trunk and do my best to stay on the exact opisite side of the trunk as the bear ? And where do i collect my nobel prize ? Please explain like I'm five.<>You collect your nobel prize when you demonstrate this . And if you do n't survive , do n't be disappointed - you can still be eligible for a Darwin award . The trunk needs to be big enough and you need to run faster than a bear for your plan to be feasible . The bear has way too much time and energy than you do . That means you will be tired before the bear even breaks a sweat chasing you . So , all I have to say is ... Good luck and Godspeed .<>It is generally not a good idea to try to escape a bear by climbing a tree. Bears are excellent climbers and may be able to follow you up the tree. In addition, some bears, such as black bears, are more likely to leave you alone if you remain calm and try to make yourself look larger by holding your arms out or using a jacket or blanket to appear bigger. \nIf you are being chased by a bear, the best thing to do is to try to get away from the bear as quickly as possible by running in a straight line. Do not run up a hill or try to climb a tree. Instead, try to put something between you and the bear, such as a car or a building, and make a lot of noise to try to scare the bear away. \nIf the bear is attacking you, try to protect your head and neck with your arms and fight back aggressively with any object that you can find, such as a stick or a rock. \nNobel Prizes are awarded to people who have made significant contributions to science, literature, or peace. They are not awarded for survival techniques or for successfully escaping from dangerous situations.<>reddit_eli5
