why is buying trading-stock from cash not regarded as an expense? <>Because the stock still has the same value as the money paid for it - you are just exchanging one asset for another (of course the stock value starts to change immediately, but for the accounting the fictional value is the buying price). For the accounting, it is similar to changing a 100$ bill in five 20$ bills - same value, still assets.<>Purchasing stock is not considered an expense because it is an investment rather than a cost. An expense is an outflow of money that is incurred in the process of generating revenue, such as the cost of goods sold or the cost of labor. In contrast, an investment is an acquisition that is made with the intention of generating income or capital appreciation in the future.When you purchase stock with cash, you are acquiring an ownership stake in a company. While there may be certain costs associated with the purchase, such as brokerage fees, these costs are typically not considered expenses. Instead, they are considered a part of the overall cost of the investment.It is worth noting that the treatment of stock purchases as investments rather than expenses can have tax implications. For example, capital gains or losses on the sale of stock are taxed differently than business expenses, which are typically deductible against revenue for tax purposes.<>finance
