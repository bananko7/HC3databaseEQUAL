I 'm a lurker - please explain reddit karma Love the community but I just do n't get why all you folks are always competing for karma . Explain like I'm five.<>Like on Whose Line is it Anyway , the points do n't matter .<>On Reddit, users can post text, links, images, and videos to the site, and other users can upvote or downvote these submissions. The number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes is called the \"karma\" of the post or comment.\n\nUsers can also earn personal karma by posting and commenting on the site. The number of upvotes minus downvotes on a user's posts and comments is their personal karma.\n\nSome users may be more interested in earning personal karma because it can be seen as a way to measure their popularity or success on the site. However, it's important to note that karma is not a measure of a person's worth or value, and it doesn't have any tangible rewards or benefits. Ultimately, the purpose of karma is to help identify the best content on the site by allowing the community to upvote or downvote it.<>reddit_eli5
