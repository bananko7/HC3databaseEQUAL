Using P\/E Ratio of an ETF to decide on asset mix<>P\/E is a useful tool for evaluating the price of a company, but only in comparison to companies in similar industries, especially for industries with well-defined cash flows.  For example, if you compared Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) to Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:HE), you'll notice that HE has a significantly higher PE. All things being equal, that means that HE may be overpriced in comparison to ED. As an investor, you need to investigate further to determine whether that is true. HE is unique in that it is a utility that also operates a bank, so you need to take that into account. You need to think about what your goal is when you say that you are a \"conservative\" investor and look at the big picture, not a magic number. If conservative to you means capital preservation, you need to ensure that you are in investments that are diversified and appropriate. Given the interest rate situation in 2011, that means your bonds holding need to be in short-duration, high-quality securities. Equities should be weighted towards large cap, with smaller holdings of international or commodity-associated funds. Consider a target-date or blended fund like one of the Vanguard \"Life Strategy\" funds.<>The price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio is a financial ratio that compares a company's current stock price to its earnings per share. It is often used as a valuation metric to gauge the relative value of a company's stock. You can also use the P\/E ratio to compare the relative value of different exchange-traded funds (ETFs).If you are considering adding an ETF to your investment portfolio, you can compare the P\/E ratio of the ETF to the P\/E ratios of other ETFs in the same asset class. If the ETF has a lower P\/E ratio than its peers, it may be considered undervalued and a potentially good value. However, it's important to note that the P\/E ratio should not be used in isolation to make investment decisions. It's just one factor to consider when evaluating an ETF or any other investment. It's always a good idea to do your own research and consider a variety of factors when making investment decisions.<>finance
