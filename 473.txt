what people used mayan numeral system<>Maya numerals are a vigesimal ( base - twenty ) numeral system used by the Pre-Columbian Maya civilization .<>The Maya civilization, which flourished in Mesoamerica (present-day Mexico and Central America) from approximately 2000 BCE to 1500 CE, used a vigesimal (base-20) numeral system to represent numbers. The Maya numeral system was used for counting, calculating, and keeping track of time.\\n\\nThe Maya numeral system was based on a combination of bar and dot symbols. The basic unit of the Maya numeral system was the dot, which represented the number 1. A bar symbol represented the number 5. The Maya numeral system used a place value system similar to the decimal system used in the modern Western world. For example, the number 18 in the Maya numeral system was represented by three dots and a bar, while the number 300 was represented by a symbol that looked like a shell.\\n\\nThe Maya numeral system was used by the Maya civilization for a wide range of purposes, including calculating the dates of celestial events, recording historical events, and keeping track of time. The Maya numeral system was also used in trade and commerce, as well as in the measurement of land and other resources. Despite the fact that the Maya civilization collapsed over 500 years ago, the Maya numeral system continues to be studied by historians and researchers today for its insights into the culture and history of the Maya civilization.","The Mayan numeral system was used by the Maya civilization of Mesoamerica, which flourished from around 2000 BC to 1500 AD. The Maya used a base-20 (vigesimal) numeral system, which means that it used 20 as its base, rather than the base-10 (decimal) system that is used in most modern societies.

This number system, known as the Maya numeral system, was used by the Maya civilization to perform various mathematical calculations, including arithmetic and geometry. The Maya numeral system was also used to record dates, times, and other important information in the Maya civilization's written records, known as codices. The Maya numeral system is still used in some traditional Maya communities in Central America and Mexico, although it has largely been replaced by the more widely used decimal number system.<>open_qa
