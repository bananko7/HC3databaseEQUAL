How has Ebola not killed us all by now ? With the recent outbreak in West Africa - highly contagious , super fatal , it seems like it would be the perfect vehicle for a \" The Stand \" type pandemic . What am I missing here ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Combination of killing the Hosts too quickly and having VERY obvious symptoms that make people avoid the infected actually make it rather difficult for Ebola to spread too far . Folks tend to avoid people vomiting up black blood ...<>Ebola is a very serious and deadly disease, but it is not as easily spread as some other infectious diseases, like the flu or common cold. Ebola is spread through close contact with the blood, secretions, or other body fluids of an infected person, or with objects that have been contaminated with these fluids. This means that it is more difficult for the disease to spread from person to person, compared to something like the flu which can be spread through the air when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Another reason why Ebola has not caused a global pandemic is that it is usually contained and controlled quickly through quarantine, isolation, and other public health measures. When an outbreak does occur, public health workers and medical professionals work quickly to identify and treat people who are infected and to trace and monitor their close contacts to prevent further spread of the disease. It's also worth noting that while Ebola can be deadly, not everyone who is infected with the virus will die. Many people who have been infected with Ebola have been able to recover with proper medical care. So while Ebola is a serious and potentially deadly disease, it has not caused a global pandemic because it is not as easily spread as some other infectious diseases and can be contained and controlled through public health measures.<>reddit_eli5
