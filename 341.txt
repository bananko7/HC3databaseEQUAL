So we need to rule out lung infection ( pneumonia ) first. Pneumonia can cause pleurisy ( inflammation of pleura ) and chest pain with coughing is characteristic feature of pleurisy. And pneumonia is the most common cause for pleurisy. So get done chest x ray first to rule pneumonia. Also get done stool microscopic examination to rule out blood in stool because he is having dark stool.So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. First diagnose himself and then start appropriate treatment. He may need antibiotic drugs.<>It is important to see a doctor for a cough that has persisted for two months and is accompanied by chest pain and dark stools. These symptoms may be signs of a more serious underlying condition that requires medical attention. The doctor will be able to determine the cause of the cough and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, it is important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest to help manage the symptoms. It is also a good idea to avoid exposure to irritants such as smoke and pollution, as they can make the cough worse.<>medicine
