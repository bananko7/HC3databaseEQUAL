If the universe is everything in existence , how is it spreading ? I know that it 's always expanding but if the universe is the entirety of everything , what is it expanding into ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I like to think of it as the surface of an inflating balloon ( the analogy fails when speaking of the actual shape of the universe ) . Draw a few points on the balloon and watch them spread apart as they inflate . If reality is the skin of the balloon , it 's not growing into something as much as the properties of that surfacs are changing . Nothing is coming into existence as it \" changes \" ( ~~2nd law of thermodynamics~~ ) all the material and everything of relevance was already there to be begin with . Edit : I should have said 1st law of thermodynamics .<>Great question! So the universe is made up of all the things that exist - stars, galaxies, planets, and everything else we can see and even things we can't see, like dark matter and dark energy. And you're right that the universe is always expanding, which means that everything in the universe is moving away from everything else. But the universe doesn't have an edge, so there's nothing for it to expand into. It's just expanding on its own, like how a balloon gets bigger when you blow it up. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
