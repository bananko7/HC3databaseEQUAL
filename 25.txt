Why did the German WW2 use a 88 mm Cannon rather than a round number like 90 mm ? Because of the association with 88 and the Hitler \" stuff \" Explain like I'm five. <>88 mm caliber was a common size for pre - WWI German navy guns . Many old gun related things are based on the diameters of various weight lead balls , and a 9 lb ( 4 kg ) lead ball is very close to 88 mm in diameter ( 88.25 mm ) .<>The 88 mm cannon was actually a gun that was used by the Germans during World War II. It was called the \"88\" because it had a bore, or inside diameter, of 88 millimeters. This made it a very effective weapon because it could fire large, powerful shells that could penetrate enemy armor and damage or destroy enemy tanks and other vehicles. The Germans chose to use this weapon because it was very effective and reliable, and it could be used in a variety of roles, including as an anti-aircraft gun and as an artillery piece. It was not related to Adolf Hitler or any other political or ideological symbol.<>reddit_eli5
