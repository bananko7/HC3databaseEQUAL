What does an x% inflation rate actually mean?<>Inflation is a reflection on the expansion of the money supply, aka debt,  being created by a central bank. Fiat currencies usually inflate, because there is no limit to the amount of debt that can be created. The consequences of reckless money supply expansion can be seen throughout history, see Zimbabwe, though there have been many others...Brazil, Argentinia, etc...<>An inflation rate of x% means that the general level of prices for goods and services in an economy is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation and avoid deflation in order to keep the economy running smoothly.For example, if the inflation rate is 3%, then a product that cost $100 last year would cost $103 this year. Inflation can be caused by various factors, such as an increase in production costs, an increase in the money supply, or a decrease in the supply of goods and services.It's important to note that the inflation rate is not the same thing as the interest rate, which is the percentage at which banks lend money to borrowers.<>finance
