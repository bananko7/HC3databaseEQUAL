It's important to be cautious when using cleaning products and to properly store and label them to prevent accidental ingestion or inhalation.\n\nInhaling concentrated cleaning solution can be harmful and may cause symptoms such as a sore throat, difficulty breathing, coughing, and dizziness. Using a toothbrush that has come into contact with mold can also be harmful, as mold can produce allergens, irritants, and potentially toxic substances known as mycotoxins.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms such as a sore throat and dizziness, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. It is important to call poison control or go to the emergency room if you are experiencing severe symptoms or if you are unsure of the effects of the substances you have inhaled or ingested.\n\nIn the meantime, try to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, and avoid inhaling any more cleaning solutions or coming into contact with mold. If your throat is sore, you may find it helpful to drink warm liquids or gargle with salt water.\n\nIt's also important to properly store and label cleaning products and to use them according to the instructions on the label. Avoid mixing different cleaning products together, as this can create harmful chemical reactions. Always use protective equipment, such as gloves and a mask, when handling concentrated cleaning solutions or working with mold.<>medicine
