He is an 8 mos old.<>This is normal report.Trophizoite is a stage  of intestinal parasites.repirt says no ova , cyst or trophozoite seen.(means normal)<>Tropozoites are a stage in the life cycle of some parasites, specifically those that belong to the Plasmodium species, which cause malaria. If tropozoites are seen in a fecal examination, it means that the person being tested is infected with a parasitic infection.\n\nPus cells, also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMNLs, are a type of white blood cell that is involved in the immune response to infections. The presence of 2-4 pus cells per high power field (hpf) in a fecal examination suggests that there is some inflammation or infection present in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nRed blood cells (RBCs) in the stool can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract. TNTC stands for \"too numerous to count,\" which means that there are so many RBCs present that it is not possible to accurately count them. This can be a sign of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nOverall, the results of the fecal examination suggest that your 8-month-old son has a parasitic infection and some inflammation or infection in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as possible bleeding. It is important to follow up with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.<>medicine
