How can we eat raw fish but raw chicken makes us sick ? Does it have to do with living in water \/ not living in water ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Lets be clear here . If you take one chicken , and one fish , and kill them both at the same time , you are just as likely to contract a disease from one as the other . However , chicken processing is gross . Same with pork and beef . Fish is kept cleaner for the intent of being sushi , and is even more expensive if it is sashimi grade . You can do the same for any meat . Steak ~~Tar Tar~~ tartare is raw beef , and it is delicious . Raw pork and chicken are slimy and kind of gross , but if it was kept to the same standards would be perfectly safe to eat . * edit . It 's Steak Tartare . I 've never seen it spelled , hopefully is better now .<>Raw fish and raw chicken are both potentially dangerous to eat because they can carry harmful bacteria that can cause food poisoning. However, raw fish is often considered safer to eat than raw chicken because fish live in water, which can help to wash away some of the bacteria that they come into contact with. Chicken, on the other hand, live on land and can come into contact with all kinds of bacteria from their environment, which can make them more likely to carry harmful bacteria that can make you sick. It's also worth noting that some types of fish, such as salmon and tuna, can contain parasites that can be harmful if ingested. These parasites can be killed by cooking the fish to a high enough temperature, but they are not killed if the fish is eaten raw. For this reason, it is important to be careful when eating raw fish, and to make sure that it has been properly handled and prepared to minimize the risk of food poisoning.<>reddit_eli5
