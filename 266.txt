What does sharp pain in the lower back upon sneezing indicate?I have sharp pain in my lower back when I sneeze or cough. I m thinking it is my kidneys. I have no history of kidney stones, however I do have a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. I get chronic UTIs. I do not have one now. Just the pain in my back\/kidneys. It is both sides. What could be causing this.<>Hi,I understands your question and I will try to help you. simply your back pain with sneezing is mostly due to myositis or muscle spasm of back muscles.. I suggest using muscle relaxant and hot fomentation.<>Sharp pain in the lower back upon sneezing or coughing can be caused by a variety of conditions, including muscle strain, kidney stones, or a urinary tract infection (UTI). If you have a history of interstitial cystitis and chronic UTIs, it's possible that the pain you're experiencing is related to one of these conditions. It's also possible that the pain could be caused by something else entirely.\n\nIf you are experiencing severe or persistent pain, it's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They will be able to determine the cause of your pain and recommend the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try applying heat to the affected area, taking over-the-counter pain medication, and drinking plenty of fluids to help manage the pain.<>medicine
