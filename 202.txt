Can I pay off my credit card balance to free up available credit?<>The card you have is one where you had to deposit an amount equivelent to your card limit -a secured limit credit card.  Capital One is one if the primary cards of this type. The typical rules of credit card usage and building your credit, do not apply.  So, yes, you want to use the card as much as possible and pay off your balance as often as is necessary to keep your limit freed up. You can actually pay the full balance plus 10%, and gain a little extra limit. Use your card as much as possible and call them and ask for a limit increase every three months.  usually about 4 - 5 months in, they will increase your limit and do so without asking for a corresponding security deposit.  This is really cool, because it means you are becoming credit-worthy. I know so much about this because I applied for this card for my son and am helping him in his attempt to repair his credit.  His score increased by almost 200 points last year.<>Yes, you can pay off your credit card balance to free up available credit. When you pay off your credit card balance, the amount of available credit on your card increases by the amount that you paid off. For example, if your credit card has a limit of $1,000 and you have a balance of $500, your available credit is $500. If you pay off the balance in full, your available credit will increase to $1,000. This can be helpful if you need to use your credit card for a large purchase and want to have a higher available credit limit. Just keep in mind that it's important to use credit responsibly and to only charge what you can afford to pay off in full each month to avoid accumulating debt.<>finance
