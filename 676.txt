Two is abnormal - share a picture for confirmation. Doing a urine complete can help diagnose the presence of sperm in urine. Also, check for blood sugar and urine culture. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. S. R. Raveendran, Sexologist<>It is not normal for sperm to be present during urination. It is possible that you may have a condition called retrograde ejaculation, in which sperm flows back into the bladder instead of out through the penis during ejaculation. This can be caused by certain medications, nerve damage, or certain medical conditions such as diabetes.\n\nIt is important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation and proper diagnosis. They can perform tests such as a urine sample or imaging studies to determine the cause of the problem and recommend appropriate treatment. Treatment may include medications or other therapies to address the underlying cause of the condition.\n\nIt is also important to note that having two holes in the penis, known as penile duplication or diphallia, is a rare condition that is present at birth. It is not related to retrograde ejaculation or any other medical condition. If you have concerns about this, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance.<>medicine
