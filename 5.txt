Why is half of my mortgage payment going to pay interest if my interest rate is 4.5 percent ? I realize it has something to do with amortization but I do n't really understand . Please explain like I'm five.<>Ok lets make the Math easy , imagine you borrowed $ 1000 at 5 % interest and every year you pay back $ 100 . That 5 % interest is added every year so : In the first year you accrue 5 % of $ 1000 or $ 50 of interest . You pay $ 100 so $ 50 pays that interest $ 50 pays down your loan you owe $ 950 still . The next year you pay 5 % of $ 950 or $ 47.5 of interest . You pay $ 100 so $ 47.5 goes to interest $ 52.50 pays down your loan you owe $ 897.50 still This keeps going with the same payment but each year more goes to paying the original loan less goes to the interest .<>Sure! I'd be happy to help explain this to you.When you take out a mortgage to buy a house, you are borrowing money from a bank to pay for the house. The bank charges you interest on the money you borrow, which is a percentage of the total amount of the mortgage. The interest rate is the percentage of the mortgage that you have to pay to the bank in addition to the amount you borrowed.When you make a mortgage payment, a portion of the payment goes towards paying off the principal, or the amount of money you borrowed. The rest of the payment goes towards paying the interest, which is the cost of borrowing the money.So, for example, if you have a mortgage with a 4.5% interest rate and you make a payment of $1000, a portion of that payment will go towards paying off the principal and the rest will go towards paying the interest. The exact amount that goes towards each will depend on the terms of your mortgage and how much you owe on the loan.Over time, as you make more and more mortgage payments, the amount you owe on the loan (the principal) will gradually decrease, and the amount of interest you owe will gradually decrease as well. This is known as amortization.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>reddit_eli5
