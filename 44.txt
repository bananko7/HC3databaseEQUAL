Please explain what is \"Strong AI hypothesis\"<>The Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot have a \"mind,\" \"understanding\" or \"consciousness,\"[a] regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980. Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714),  Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle's version has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of Searle's argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.\nThe argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls strong AI: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[b]\nAlthough it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of mainstream AI research because it does not show a limit in the amount of \"intelligent\" behavior a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.<>The strong AI hypothesis is the idea that it is possible to create artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of exhibiting intelligent behavior that is equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, human intelligence. This means that a strong AI system would be able to understand and learn about the world in the same way that a human does, and would be able to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn from experience, just like a human.\n\n\n\nThe strong AI hypothesis is often contrasted with the weak AI hypothesis, which states that AI systems can only be designed to perform specific tasks, and cannot exhibit general intelligence or understand the world in the same way that a human does. While weak AI systems may be able to perform specific tasks very well, they are not capable of adapting to new situations or learning in the same way that a human can.\n\n\n\nThe strong AI hypothesis has been a subject of much discussion and debate in the field of artificial intelligence and philosophy, and there are differing opinions on whether it is possible to create a strong AI system. Some people believe that it is only a matter of time before strong AI becomes a reality, while others argue that it may never be possible to create a machine that is truly intelligent in the same way that a human is.<>wiki_csai
