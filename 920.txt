music time signatures What exactly are they ? How does it relate to the rhythm of the song and how do you identify a pieces time signature ? Explain like I'm five. <>The upper number is the number of beats per measure , and the lower number is the kind of note gets the beat . 4\/4 ( also called \" common time \" and designated with a C ) gets 4 beats and each one is a quarter note ( 1\/4 ) . A time signature of 7\/8 means that there are 7 beats per measure , and each one is an eighth note Most popular music is written in 4\/4 . It 's simple to count and makes a lot of \" sense \" musically . As we move away from common time , there 's a different \" feeling \" that goes with other time signatures . Lots of waltzes are written in 3\/4 ( but some are written in 6\/8 to emphasize that you take two steps per measure ) . Lots of marches are written in 2\/4 to make it easy to step left - right - left - right through the music . Beyond practical concerns , there are artistic concerns . A musician or composer might like the way a certain signature counts or might feel that it gives their music the plodding \/ lively \/ whimsical \/ whatever quality they 're going for in writing the thing .<>A time signature is a symbol that tells you how many beats are in each measure of music and what kind of note gets one beat. It looks like a fraction, with two numbers one on top of the other. The number on the top tells you how many beats are in each measure, and the number on the bottom tells you what kind of note gets one beat. For example, a time signature of 4\/4 means that there are four beats in each measure and a quarter note gets one beat. A time signature of 3\/4 means that there are three beats in each measure and a quarter note gets one beat.\\n\\nTo identify a piece's time signature, you can look at the very beginning of the music, where the time signature is usually written. It's also common to find the time signature written at the beginning of each line of music.\\n\\nThe time signature helps you understand the rhythm of the song. It tells you how many beats to count before you start the song over again. It also tells you which notes to hold for longer and which notes to play quickly. For example, in 4\/4 time, you might hold a whole note for four beats and then play four quarter notes quickly. In 3\/4 time, you might hold a whole note for three beats and then play three quarter notes quickly.<>reddit_eli5
