How does the bail system work in the USA ? if you ' post bail ' of $ 15,000 , say , do you get it back or what ? Do you get it back if the person was innocent or is it gone either way ? Explain like I'm five.<>After you are arrested , the state wants a guarantee that you will show up for court . The \" bail \" money is used to coerce you into compliance . You get the money back when the case is disposed of , guilty or not , as long as you appear in court when you 're told . If you do n't show up , you have \" jumped bail \" and the cops and maybe Dog the bounty hunter will come looking for you .<>The bail system in the United States is a way for people who have been arrested and charged with a crime to get out of jail while they wait for their trial. When someone is arrested, a judge will decide how much money they have to pay in order to get out of jail. This is called bail. If the person pays the bail, they can go home and wait for their trial. If they show up to all their court dates, they will get their bail money back. If they don't show up to court, they can lose their bail money. If the person is found guilty of the crime they were charged with, they will not get their bail money back. If they are found innocent, they will get their bail money back. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
