What does a well diversified self-managed investment portfolio look like?<>I would like to first point out that there is nothing special about a self-managed investment portfolio as compared to one managed by someone else. With some exceptions, you can put together exactly the same investment portfolio yourself as a professional investor could put together for you. Not uncommonly, too, at a lower cost (and remember that cost is among the, if not the, best indicator(s) of how your investment portfolio will perform over time). Diversification is the concept of not \"putting all your eggs in one basket\". The idea here is that there are things that happen together because they have a common cause, and by spreading your investments in ways such that not all of your investments have the same underlying risks, you reduce your overall risk. The technical term for risk is generally volatility, meaning how much (in this case the price of) something fluctuates over a given period of time. A stock that falls 30% one month and then climbs 40% the next month is more volatile than one that falls 3% the first month and climbs 4% the second month. The former is riskier because if for some reason you need to sell when it is down, you lose a larger portion of your original investment with the former stock than with the latter. Diversification, thus, is reducing commonality between your investments, generally but not necessarily in an attempt to reduce the risk of all investments moving in the same direction by the same amount at the same time. You can diversify in various ways: Do you see where I am going with this? A well-diversed portfolio will tend to have a mix of equity in your own country and a variety of other countries, spread out over different types of equity (company stock, corporate bonds, government bonds, ...), in different sectors of the economy, in countries with differing growth patterns. It may contain uncommon classes of investments such as precious metals. A poorly diversified portfolio will likely be restricted to either some particular geographical area, type of equity or investment, focus on some particular sector of the economy (such as medicine or vehicle manufacturers), or so on. The poorly diversified portfolio can do better in the short term, if you time it just right and happen to pick exactly the right thing to buy or sell. This is incredibly hard to do, as you are basically working against everyone who gets paid to do that kind of work full time, plus computer-algorithm-based trading which is programmed to look for any exploitable patterns. It is virtually impossible to do for any real length of time. Thus, the well-diversified portfolio tends to do better over time.<>A well-diversified investment portfolio is one that contains a variety of different asset classes and securities in order to spread risk and maximize potential returns. A self-managed investment portfolio is one that is managed by the individual investor rather than a professional investment manager.Here are some key factors to consider when building a well-diversified self-managed investment portfolio:Asset allocation: This refers to the mix of different asset classes in your portfolio, such as stocks, bonds, cash, and alternatives. The right asset allocation will depend on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A well-diversified portfolio typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash, with the proportion of each asset class depending on your investment objectives and risk profile.Diversification within asset classes: It's important to diversify within each asset class as well. For example, within the stock portion of your portfolio, you should consider owning a mix of large cap, mid cap, and small cap stocks, as well as stocks from different sectors and industries. This helps to spread risk and reduce the impact of any one security or sector on your overall portfolio.Geographical diversification: You should also consider diversifying your portfolio by owning securities from different countries and regions. This helps to reduce the impact of any one country or region on your portfolio.Diversification by investment type: You should also consider diversifying your portfolio by owning different types of investments, such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), individual stocks, and bonds. This helps to spread risk and provide exposure to a wide range of investment opportunities.It's important to periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains well-diversified and aligned with your investment objectives. This may involve selling some securities and buying others to maintain the desired asset allocation.<>finance
