My daughter has a mole on gums and she is 6 years old. What i can do ?Hello doctor ,my daughter 6 years having a pea size mole on her gums and she complain of tooth ache of same teeth where mole is there.please help me<>Hi,    The mole on your childs gums is a gumboil. It is an abscess of the tooth which is aching. The tooth might be decayed and should be root canal treated after which the gumboil would disappear. Pl consult your dentist at the earliest.<>I'm sorry, but I am not a medical professional and cannot give you advice on your daughter's condition. It is important to have a mole on the gums or anywhere else on the body checked by a doctor or dental professional. Moles on the gums or inside the mouth can sometimes be a sign of a type of skin cancer called melanoma, which can be serious if not treated promptly.\n\nI recommend that you make an appointment with your daughter's dentist or pediatrician as soon as possible. They will be able to examine the mole and determine if it needs to be removed or if any further treatment is necessary. They will also be able to address your daughter's toothache and determine if it is related to the mole. In the meantime, try to keep the area clean and avoid biting or picking at the mole.\n\nIt's also important to note that moles are usually benign (non-cancerous), and many people have moles on their skin or inside their mouth. However, it is always best to have any unusual growths or changes in the mouth or on the skin checked by a medical professional to be sure.<>medicine
