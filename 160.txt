How do gas stations get away with selling drug paraphernalia like bowls and grinders ? Edit : Not sure if it 's bowl or pipe , I 'm not very familiar with that kind of stuff . Sorry if I was wrong . Please explain like I'm five.<>Because there 's nothing about a bowl or a grinder that 's inherently tied to illegal drug usage . You could be using them for tobacco , for all they know ! It 's the same reason head shops can exist . Until it 's coated in marijuana residue , a bowl is not necessarily paraphernalia .<>It is generally not legal for gas stations to sell drug paraphernalia, which includes items like pipes, bongs, and grinders that are primarily used for consuming illegal drugs. However, some gas stations may still sell these items because they can be used for other purposes as well, such as grinding herbs for cooking or tobacco for smoking. In these cases, the gas station may argue that they are not intending for the items to be used for illegal purposes, and they are simply selling them as everyday products. \nIt's worth noting that the laws regarding the sale of drug paraphernalia vary by state and country, and it's possible that some gas stations may be breaking the law by selling these items. If you have concerns about a gas station selling drug paraphernalia, you can contact your local authorities or speak to the management of the gas station.<>reddit_eli5
