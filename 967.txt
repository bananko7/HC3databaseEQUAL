PayPal wants me to “add a bank account”, another funding source. Credit card isn't working. Why?<>It's always a good idea to check your credit history on a regular basis - try checking your credit score from one of the independent providers recently (like Equifax) ?  Maybe that will offer a clue what PayPal is doing.<>There could be a few reasons why your credit card is not working with PayPal. Here are a few possible explanations:Insufficient funds: If you do not have enough money in your credit card account to cover the transaction, it will be declined.Incorrect information: Make sure that you have entered all of your credit card information correctly, including the card number, expiration date, and security code.Card issuer decline: Your credit card issuer may decline the transaction for various reasons, such as suspected fraudulent activity or reaching your credit limit.PayPal account limitations: PayPal may have placed limitations on your account, which can prevent you from using your credit card for transactions.If you are unable to use your credit card with PayPal and are asked to add a bank account as an additional funding source, you can do so by following these steps:Log in to your PayPal account.Click on the \"Wallet\" tab at the top of the page.Click on the \"Link a bank\" button.Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your bank account information and link the account to your PayPal account.I hope this helps!
