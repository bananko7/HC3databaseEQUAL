Suggest treatment for chest viral infectionI've just been prescribed prednisolone for a viral chest infection (I've got asthma and am having trouble breathing), but forgot to make sure my GP knew I'm also taking Microgynon 30 for contraception (I've been getting it from the family planning drop-in clinic, and they don't share records with your GP).Will this combination affect either drug's effectiveness?<>Hi thanks for contacting HCM...You might have prescribed short term steroid...With microgynon it could be taken...Mainly microgynon not taken along with immunosuppressive and some antifungal drugs....As you have asthma consult physician for starting maintainance inhaler if repeated infection...Steam inhalation useful....You can take equal amount of mixed ginger juice and honey one tsp two time daily that is good remedy....For decongestion eucalyptus helpful....Take care.<>It is important to let your healthcare provider know about all medications you are taking, including any over-the-counter or herbal remedies, to ensure that you are receiving the most appropriate treatment and to minimize the risk of potential interactions.\n\nPrednisolone is a corticosteroid that is often used to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma. It works by reducing inflammation in the airways, which can help to alleviate symptoms such as difficulty breathing. Microgynon 30 is a combination birth control pill that contains both an estrogen and a progestin. It is not clear how taking these medications together may affect their effectiveness.\n\nIt is important to follow your healthcare provider's instructions for taking prednisolone and Microgynon 30. If you have any concerns about the potential interactions between these medications, or if you experience any unusual symptoms while taking them, you should contact your healthcare provider for further guidance.<>medicine
