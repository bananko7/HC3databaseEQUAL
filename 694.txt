Please explain what is \"Evolutionary algorithm\"<>In computational intelligence (CI), an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.<>An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a type of optimization algorithm that uses principles inspired by the process of natural evolution to find solutions to problems. EAs are commonly used to find solutions to problems that are too difficult to be solved using traditional algorithms or that have too many variables to be solved using brute force methods.\n\n\n\nEAs work by mimicking the process of natural selection and evolution. This process involves the following steps:\n\n\n\nInitialization: A population of solutions is generated randomly or using some heuristic method.\n\n\n\nEvaluation: The solutions in the population are evaluated based on some predetermined objective function. The objective function measures how well a particular solution fits the problem.\n\n\n\nSelection: The solutions in the population are ranked based on their fitness, and the fittest solutions are selected to be used in the next generation.\n\n\n\nReproduction: The selected solutions are used to produce a new generation of solutions through processes such as crossover (combining solutions from different parents) and mutation (randomly altering solutions).\n\n\n\nRepeat: The process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found or a predetermined number of iterations have been completed.\n\n\n\nEAs are particularly useful for solving problems that are difficult to solve using traditional algorithms because they are able to find good solutions in a relatively short amount of time, even when the problem is very complex. EAs are also able to handle problems with many variables and can find good solutions even when there are multiple conflicting objectives.<>wiki_csai
