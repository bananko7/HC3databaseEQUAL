Please explain what is \"Non-monotonic logic\"<>A non-monotonic logic is a formal logic whose conclusion relation is not monotonic. In other words, non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible inferences (cf. defeasible reasoning), i.e., a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract their conclusion(s) based on further evidence.\nMost studied formal logics have a monotonic entailment relation, meaning that adding a formula to a theory never produces a pruning of its set of conclusions. Intuitively, monotonicity indicates that learning a new piece of knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known. A monotonic logic cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default (conclusions may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary), abductive reasoning (conclusions are only deduced as most likely explanations), some important approaches  to reasoning about knowledge (the ignorance of a conclusion must be retracted when the conclusion becomes known), and similarly, belief revision (new  knowledge may contradict old beliefs).<>Non-monotonic logic is a type of logic that allows for the revision of conclusions based on new information. In contrast to monotonic logic, which holds that once a conclusion is reached it cannot be revised, non-monotonic logic allows for the possibility of revising conclusions as new information becomes available.\n\n\n\nThere are several different types of non-monotonic logics, including default logic, autoepistemic logic, and circumscription. These logics are used in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, philosophy, and linguistics, to model reasoning under uncertainty and to handle incomplete or inconsistent information.\n\n\n\nIn default logic, conclusions are reached by assuming a set of default assumptions to be true unless there is evidence to the contrary. This allows for the possibility of revising conclusions as new information becomes available.\n\n\n\nAutoepistemic logic is a type of non-monotonic logic that is used to model reasoning about one's own beliefs. In this logic, conclusions can be revised as new information becomes available, and the process of revising conclusions is based on the principle of belief revision.\n\n\n\nCircumscription is a type of non-monotonic logic that is used to model reasoning about incomplete or inconsistent information. In this logic, conclusions are reached by considering only a subset of the available information, with the goal of arriving at the most reasonable conclusion given the limited information.\n\n\n\nNon-monotonic logics are useful in situations where information is uncertain or incomplete, and where it is necessary to be able to revise conclusions as new information becomes available. They have been applied in a variety of fields, including artificial intelligence, philosophy, and linguistics, to model reasoning under uncertainty and to handle incomplete or inconsistent information.<>wiki_csai
