what hormones produce thyroid<>The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are tyrosine -based hormones produced by the thyroid gland that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism.<>The thyroid gland produces two main hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones regulate the body's metabolism and energy levels. They do this by controlling the rate at which the body uses nutrients and oxygen to produce energy.\\n\\nThyroxine (T4) is the primary hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It is converted into the more active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in other parts of the body, such as the liver and kidneys. T3 has a stronger effect on the body's metabolism than T4.\\n\\nThe production and release of thyroid hormones is regulated by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, which are located in the brain. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release T4 and T3.\\n\\nAbnormal levels of thyroid hormones can lead to a number of health problems, such as hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) and hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone levels). These conditions are often treated with medications that either stimulate or inhibit the production of thyroid hormones.","The thyroid gland produces two hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T4 is the primary hormone produced by the thyroid gland, while T3 is a more active form of thyroid hormone and is produced in smaller amounts. Both T4 and T3 are important for regulating the body's metabolism, which is the process by which the body converts food into energy. T4 and T3 help to regulate the body's metabolic rate, which is the rate at which the body burns calories.\\n\\nThe production and release of T4 and T3 are regulated by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, which are located in the brain. The hypothalamus releases a hormone called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release T4 and T3. The levels of T4 and T3 in the blood are regulated by feedback mechanisms that involve the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland. If the levels of T4 and T3 are too low, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland will release more TRH and TSH, which will stimulate the thyroid gland to produce and release more T4 and T3. If the levels of T4 and T3 are too high, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland will release less TRH and TSH, which will reduce the production and release of T4 and T3.","The thyroid gland produces two main hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are produced in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain.\\n\\nThyroxine (T4) is the primary hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It is a hormone that is involved in the regulation of metabolism, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Thyroxine is converted to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in the body's tissues.\\n\\nTriiodothyronine (T3) is the active form of thyroid hormone. It is involved in the regulation of metabolism and has a more potent effect on the body than thyroxine.\\n\\nBoth T4 and T3 play important roles in maintaining normal body function. They help to regulate the body's energy production, growth and development, and body temperature. Dysregulation of thyroid hormone production can lead to conditions such as hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) or hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone levels).<>open_qa
