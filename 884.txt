Please explain what is \"Gradient descent\"<>In mathematics, gradient descent (also often called steepest descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.\nGradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.<>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients and biases) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function.\n\n\n\nIn machine learning, we often want to find the parameters that minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. The cost function quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual output and the goal of the optimization is to find the values of the parameters that minimize this difference, or cost.\n\n\n\nThe gradient descent algorithm works by starting with initial guesses for the parameters and then iteratively adjusting them to reduce the cost. At each step, the algorithm computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient is a vector that indicates the direction of steepest descent. The algorithm then updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, since this will reduce the cost. This process is repeated until the cost function is minimized or until a predefined number of iterations is reached.\n\n\n\nThere are several variations of the gradient descent algorithm, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. The choice of which variant to use depends on the specific problem and the available computational resources.<>wiki_csai
