Please explain what is \"Hidden Markov model\"<>A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process — call it \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n — with unobservable (\"hidden\") states. As part of the definition, HMM requires that there be an observable process \n\n\n\nY\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y}\n\n whose outcomes are \"influenced\" by the outcomes of \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n in a known way. Since \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n cannot be observed directly, the goal is to learn about \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n by observing \n\n\n\nY\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y.}\n\n HMM has an additional requirement that the outcome of \n\n\n\nY\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y}\n\n at time \n\n\n\nt\n=\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t=t_{0}}\n\n must be \"influenced\" exclusively by the outcome of \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n at \n\n\n\nt\n=\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t=t_{0}}\n\n and that the outcomes of \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n and \n\n\n\nY\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y}\n\n at \n\n\n\nt\n<\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t<t_{0}}\n\n must not affect the outcome of \n\n\n\nY\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y}\n\n at \n\n\n\nt\n=\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t=t_{0}.}\n\n\nHidden Markov models are known for their applications to thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, physics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory, pattern recognition - such as speech , handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics.<>!\n\nnetwork error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was an error generating a response<>wiki_csai
