It's important to keep in mind that infants, especially those under 2 years of age, are more at risk for serious complications from respiratory infections like colds and the flu. Therefore, it's important to seek medical advice if your daughter is experiencing fever, cough, or other symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things you can try to help your daughter feel better:\n\nOffer plenty of fluids: Make sure your daughter is getting enough fluids to stay hydrated. Offer her breast milk or formula if she's still breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, or give her water or electrolyte solutions if she's old enough for them.\n\nUse a humidifier: A humidifier can help to moisten the air and make it easier for your daughter to breathe.\n\nKeep her nose clear: Use a saline nose spray or drops to help clear your daughter's stuffy nose. You can also use a bulb syringe to gently suction out any excess mucus.\n\nGive her over-the-counter fever reducer: If your daughter's fever is over 101°F (38.3°C), you can give her an age-appropriate dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) to help reduce the fever. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the label.\n\nKeep her comfortable: Dress your daughter in lightweight clothing and make sure the room is not too hot or too cold. Offer her a warm bath to help lower her body temperature and make her more comfortable.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider if your daughter's symptoms persist or if she is not showing any improvement. They can advise you on the best course of treatment and determine if your daughter needs further medical attention.<>medicine
