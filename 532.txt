Paying Tax on Stocks Trading<>The answer to your question doesn't depend on who you trade with but what country you live in. If you live outside of the US, you will have to pay tax on dividends... sometimes. This depends on the tax treaty that your country has with the US. Canada, Australia, UK and a few other countries have favorable tax treaties with the US that allow you to not be double taxed. You must look into the tax treaty that your home country has with the US to answer the question. Each country is different.<>In the United States, you will generally have to pay taxes on your profits from trading stocks. If you buy and sell a stock within a year, it will be considered a short-term capital gain and will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. If you hold the stock for longer than a year before selling it, it will be considered a long-term capital gain and will be taxed at a lower rate. There are limits on how much of your capital gains can be taxed at the lower rate, depending on your income. You may also have to pay taxes on dividends you receive from stocks, although there are some exceptions. It's a good idea to consult a tax professional or refer to IRS guidance if you have questions about how your stock trading will be taxed.<>finance
