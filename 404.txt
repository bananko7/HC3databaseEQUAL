Please explain what is \"Image classification\"<>Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.\nComputer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.\nThe scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3D scanner, or medical scanning devices. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.\nSub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration.<>Image classification is a task in computer vision that involves assigning a class label to an image or image segment. It is a type of supervised learning, where a model is trained on a labeled dataset of images and their corresponding class labels, and then can predict the class label of an unseen image.\n\n\n\nThere are many different approaches to image classification, including traditional machine learning methods like support vector machines (SVMs) and decision trees, as well as more recent deep learning approaches that use convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n\n\n\nIn general, the goal of image classification is to take an input image and output a class label that best describes the content of the image. This can be useful for a wide range of applications, such as object recognition in photos or videos, facial recognition, and scene understanding.<>wiki_csai
