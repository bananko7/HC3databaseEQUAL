Please explain what is \"Dropout (neural networks)\"<>Dilution and dropout (also called DropConnect) are regularization techniques for reducing overfitting in artificial neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. They are an efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. Dilution refers to thinning weights, while dropout refers to randomly \"dropping out\", or omitting, units (both hidden and visible) during the training process of a neural network. Both trigger the same type of regularization.<>In machine learning and neural networks, dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting. It works by randomly \"dropping out\" a certain number of neurons during training, which means temporarily setting the output of those neurons to zero. This has the effect of reducing the dependence of the model on any one particular neuron, and can help the model generalize better to new data.\n\n\n\nDropout is typically applied to fully-connected layers in a neural network, although it can also be applied to convolutional layers. It is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques such as weight decay (L2 regularization) and early stopping.\n\n\n\nTo implement dropout in a neural network, we randomly set a certain percentage of neurons to zero during each training iteration. During inference (i.e., when making predictions on new data), we do not use dropout and instead use the entire network. This has the effect of \"averaging\" the predictions of all the dropped-out neurons, which helps reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n\n\n\nDropout has been shown to be effective at reducing overfitting in deep neural networks and is a common technique used in modern deep learning models.<>wiki_csai
