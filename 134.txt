Please explain what is \"Neuromorphic computing\"<>Neuromorphic engineering, also known as neuromorphic computing, is the use of electronic circuits to mimic neuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system. A neuromorphic computer\/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons (made from silicon) to do computations. In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog\/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g., using Python based frameworks such as snnTorch,[10] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g., using BindsNet.[11]\nA key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.\nNeuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems.[12] One of the first applications for neuromorphic engineering was proposed by Carver Mead[13] in the late 1980s.<>Neuromorphic computing is a type of computing that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It involves creating computer systems that are designed to mimic the way that the brain works, with the goal of creating more efficient and effective ways of processing information.\n\n\n\nIn the brain, neurons and synapses work together to process and transmit information. Neuromorphic computing systems aim to replicate this process using artificial neurons and synapses, often implemented using specialized hardware. This hardware can take a variety of forms, including electronic circuits, photonics, or even mechanical systems.\n\n\n\nOne of the key features of neuromorphic computing systems is their ability to process and transmit information in a highly parallel and distributed manner. This allows them to perform certain tasks much more efficiently than traditional computers, which are based on sequential processing.\n\n\n\nNeuromorphic computing has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications, including machine learning, pattern recognition, and decision making. It may also have important implications for fields such as neuroscience, where it could provide new insights into how the brain works.<>wiki_csai
