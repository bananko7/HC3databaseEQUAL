where do women ejeculation exactly coming from<>Female ejaculation is the expulsion of fluid by human females from the paraurethral ducts through and around the female urethra during or before an orgasm .<>Female ejaculation is a term used to describe the release of fluid that comes from the Skene's glands, which are located near the female urethra. These glands are sometimes referred to as the \"female prostate\" because they produce a fluid that is similar to the prostate fluid produced by the male prostate gland. During sexual arousal, the Skene's glands may produce and release this fluid, which can be expelled through the urethra. Some people refer to this as \"squirting\" or \"gushing.\" It is not uncommon for women to release small amounts of urine during sexual arousal or orgasm, and this can sometimes be mistaken for female ejaculation. However, the fluid produced by the Skene's glands is not urine and is not harmful. The amount of fluid released during female ejaculation can vary from person to person and may not occur in every sexual encounter.","Female ejaculation is the release of fluid from the female prostate, also known as the Skene's gland or paraurethral gland, during sexual arousal or orgasm. The fluid is typically clear or milky in color and may have a slightly sweet or musky smell. It is not urine, but rather a combination of prostatic secretions and other fluids produced by the Skene's gland and other glands in the vulva. The amount of fluid that is released during female ejaculation can vary widely from person to person. Some women may experience female ejaculation regularly, while others may never experience it at all. It is a normal and healthy part of human sexuality and is not indicative of any medical problem.","Female ejaculation is the expulsion of fluid from the vulva or vagina during sexual arousal and orgasm. The fluid is expelled through the urethra, the same channel that carries urine from the bladder.\\n\\nThe fluid produced during female ejaculation is sometimes called \"squirt,\" \"gush,\" or \"juice.\" It is typically clear and has a similar composition to prostate fluid, which is produced by the prostate gland in men. The volume of fluid expelled during female ejaculation can vary widely, from a small amount to a large gush.\\n\\nIt is important to note that not all women experience female ejaculation and there is ongoing debate and research about the nature and source of the fluid. Some researchers believe that the fluid is produced by the Skene's glands, which are located near the urethra. Others believe that it may come from the bladder or be a combination of fluid from the Skene's glands and the urinary system.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that female ejaculation is not the same as vaginal lubrication, which is a normal physiological response to sexual arousal that helps to reduce friction and discomfort during sexual activity.<>open_qa
