How does a food company determine what a serving size is ? For example , Kraft peanut butter 's serving size is 15 g. Why not 10 grams or 20 grams ? Please explain like I'm five.<>They 're required to put the nutrition on their labels , but after that it 's fair game . They typically want to put a nice number on there for calories but will disguise by dividing it and calling it a \" serving size \" . People will see \" 100 calories \" and like that part , even if there are 10 servings and the whole thing is about 1,000 calories .<>Great question! A serving size is the amount of food that is recommended for a person to eat at one time. Food companies determine serving sizes based on how much food people typically eat at one time. For example, the serving size for peanut butter might be 15 grams because that is about the amount of peanut butter that people usually eat at one time. It's not necessarily 10 grams or 20 grams because those amounts might be too small or too large.<>reddit_eli5
