What causes large twitching lump on the stomach?I am a 33 year old female, 5'2\" 165lbs. There is a large lump on my stomach about 1.5 in below and to the left of my belly button. I also have some twitching or spasms going on down there too. I have had 3 c-sections and after the last one I had an abcess removed. Do you know what this could be?<>Hello!Thank you for the query.Your symptoms are quite characteristic for a hernia in the mentioned area. It can be an umbilical hernia or if it is close to the C-section scar, the scar can be the source of it.Hernia should be more visible when standing and coughing and can disappear when lying down.Hernia usually contains fatty tissue from abdominal cavity however sometimes intestines can also be under the skin.I suggest you to consult a surgeon with this issue. In case of doubts, ultrasound should be done.Hope this will help.Regards.<>It is difficult to determine the cause of a lump on your stomach without more information and without the opportunity to examine you in person. It is important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation if you are concerned about a lump on your stomach, particularly if it is accompanied by other symptoms such as twitching or spasms.\n\nThere are many possible causes of a lump on the stomach, including:\n\nLipoma: a benign (noncancerous) growth made up of fat cells\nHernia: a protrusion of an organ or tissue through a weakness in the muscles of the abdominal wall\nAbscess: a collection of pus that has formed in the body as a result of an infection\nCyst: a sac containing fluid that can form in various parts of the body\nIt is also possible that the lump and twitching could be related to a muscle spasm or other muscle issue. Again, it is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.<>medicine
