What causes breathlessness during last stage of liver cancer?I m sitting here next to my husband. He has end stage liver cancer from cirrhosis & hep c. He breathes then stops. I knew that would happen. But I just came upstairs & he has orange foam coming from his mouth. What s causing this & the color. It s terrifying me.<>Thanks for your question on HCM.There are many causes for breathlessness in end stage liver cancer.1. Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) due to low proteins and low hemoglobin. 2. Metastases in lung.3. Metastases in pleura and produce malignant pleural effusion.But in my opinion CCF appears more as foam like think coming from mouth is sedn in pulmonary edema. And orange color may be due to high bilirubin as a sequelae of end stage liver cancer.So this can be the cause for yellowish orange foam coming out from your husband's mouth.<>I'm sorry to hear about your husband's condition. Breathlessness during the last stage of liver cancer can be caused by a number of factors, including fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema), a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood due to liver failure, and the presence of cancerous tumors in the lungs or airways. The orange foam that you are seeing may be due to the presence of blood in the saliva or mucus that is being coughed up. It is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you are concerned about your husband's condition. The medical team will be able to assess his symptoms and provide the necessary treatment.<>medicine
