While it is possible that the heart may have to work less hard if a person has lost multiple limbs, this would depend on the specific circumstances and the overall health of the person. For example, if a person loses multiple limbs in an accident or due to an illness, their overall health may be impaired and they may have a shorter lifespan. On the other hand, if a person loses multiple limbs due to a medical condition or treatment (such as cancer) and is otherwise healthy, they may not experience a significant change in their lifespan. In general, it is important to maintain good overall health through a healthy diet, exercise, and regular check-ups with a healthcare provider in order to live a long and healthy life.<>reddit_eli5
