What is my computer doing while it is frozen ? It is obviously doing something because it is using power and still putting out warm air like it would under normal use . Please explain like I'm five.<>There are three main ways in which a program can freeze : 1\\. * * Unresponsive UI * * The program becomes unresponsive in that the user interface does n't appear to respond to input , it might not produce any output and in some cases a graphical user interface might stop being draw . In this case the program might still be running fine . This is often caused by poor programming , resulting in the program doing lots of work or waiting for something to complete on the same thread that 's running the UI . The correct way to do this is to have a thread dedicated to handling the UI , while background work or blocking tasks are completed in a separate thread . This allows the UI to continue to respond even when other parts of the program are busy completing work or waiting for work to be completed . --- 2\\. * * Infinite loop * * The program actually gets stuck in a loop , where it 's just repeatedly doing the same thing over and over . There are several possible reasons why this might occur , but usually the problem is a program bug or poorly behaving code . An example might be a retry loop without any retry counter . This is basically code which continues to retry the same operation until it works . The problem is , if the operation continues to fail for the same reason ( e.g. the program is trying to access a server that 's down ) , the program will just keep trying forever , while appearing frozen . A better way to handle this is to have the code only retry up to some maximum number of attempts before giving up and presenting an error to the user . --- 3\\. * * Blocking Program * * The program gets stuck waiting for something to complete or some resource to be made available . Again , usually the problem is a program bug or poorly behaving code . Consider the following example . When there is a shared resource , but two different threads trying to use it at the same time , the resource has to be protected with some kind of lock , otherwise the two threads could trample over each other and corrupt the resource . Imagine , for example , if two separate threads were both trying to write the line \" Hello , world \" to a file at the same time . The expected result would be two lines containing \" Hello , world \" , but if they both try to do it at the same time , the result might be garbled to something like \" Helhellolo , w , wororldld \" . So both threads try to lock the file , and only one succeeds . The one that does n't succeed is blocked until the lock is made available again by the first thread . Sometimes threads will try to access multiple resource and need to lock several at the same time . A common programming bug occurs when thread A locks resource 1 and tries to then lock resource 2 , while thread B locks resource 2 then tries to lock resource 1 . A is blocked in its attempt to access resource 2 because it 's locked by B , while at the same time B is blocked in its attempt to access resource 1 because it 's locked by A. Neither thread can proceed and the 2 threads become stuck , waiting forever for the respective locks to be released . This is called a deadlock and is a frequent cause of frozen programs .<>When a computer appears to be \"frozen,\" it usually means that it is not responding to input from the user. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as a software bug, a problem with the operating system, or a hardware issue. Even though the computer is not responding to input, it is still using power and generating heat because it is still running. The processor (the \"brain\" of the computer) is still working, even if it is not able to execute instructions or respond to user input. If your computer is frozen, the best thing to do is to try to \"force quit\" any programs that might be causing the problem. On a Windows computer, you can do this by pressing the \"Ctrl,\" \"Alt,\" and \"Delete\" keys at the same time and then selecting the \"Task Manager\" option. On a Mac, you can use the \"Command,\" \"Option,\" and \"Escape\" keys to bring up the \"Force Quit\" window. If that doesn't work, you may need to restart your computer by pressing the power button.<>reddit_eli5
