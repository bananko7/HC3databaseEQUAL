Please explain what is \"Java (programming language)\"<>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019[update], Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]\nJava was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. \nAs of September 2022[update], Java 19 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.<>Java is a popular programming language that is widely used for building a variety of applications, including web, mobile, and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented language, which means that it is based on the concept of \"objects\", which can represent real-world entities and can contain both data and code.\n\n\n\nJava was developed in the mid-1990s by a team led by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle). It was designed to be easy to learn and use, and to be easy to write, debug, and maintain. Java has a syntax that is similar to other popular programming languages, such as C and C++, so it is relatively easy for programmers to learn.\n\n\n\nJava is known for its portability, which means that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes it an ideal choice for building applications that need to run on a variety of platforms.\n\n\n\nIn addition to being used for building standalone applications, Java is also used for building web-based applications and server-side applications. It is a popular choice for building Android mobile applications, and it is also used in many other areas, including scientific applications, financial applications, and games.<>wiki_csai
