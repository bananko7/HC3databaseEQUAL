Please explain what is \"Global surveillance disclosure\"<>Ongoing news reports in the international media have revealed operational details about the Anglophone cryptographic agencies' global surveillance of both foreign and domestic nationals. The reports mostly emanate from a cache of top secret documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which he obtained whilst working for Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States. In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowden's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive \"Five Eyes\" network. In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian, attracting considerable public attention. The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably The New York Times (United States), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Der Spiegel (Germany), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), L'espresso (Italy), NRC Handelsblad (the Netherlands), Dagbladet (Norway), El País (Spain), and Sveriges Television (Sweden).\nThese media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance. For example, Der Spiegel revealed how the German Federal Intelligence Service (German: Bundesnachrichtendienst; BND) transfers \"massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA\", while Swedish Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection, under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance. Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia (ASD), Britain (GCHQ), Canada (CSE), Denmark (PET), France (DGSE), Germany (BND), Italy (AISE), the Netherlands (AIVD), Norway (NIS), Spain (CNI), Switzerland (NDB), Singapore (SID) as well as Israel (ISNU), which receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA.[10][11][12][13][14][15]\nOn June 14, 2013, United States prosecutors charged Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. In late July 2013, he was granted a one-year temporary asylum by the Russian government,[16] contributing to a deterioration of Russia–United States relations.[17][18] Towards the end of October 2013, the British Prime Minister David Cameron warned The Guardian not to publish any more leaks, or it will receive a DA-Notice.[19] In November 2013, a criminal investigation of the disclosure was being undertaken by Britain's Metropolitan Police Service.[20] In December 2013, The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: \"We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 we've seen.\"[21]\nThe extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed. In January 2014, Obama said that \"the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light\"[22] and critics such as Sean Wilentz have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance.[23] The US & British Defense establishment weigh the strategic harm in the period following the disclosures more heavily than their civic public benefit. In its first assessment of these disclosures, the Pentagon concluded that Snowden committed the biggest \"theft\" of U.S. secrets in the history of the United States.[24] Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, described Snowden's disclosure as the \"most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever\".[25]<>Global surveillance refers to the practice of governments and other organizations around the world collecting and analyzing information about individuals, groups, and nations for various purposes. This can include activities such as intercepting electronic communications, monitoring social media activity, and collecting data from devices such as phones and computers.\n\n\n\nThe term \"global surveillance disclosure\" generally refers to the public revelation of information about these types of activities, often through the efforts of investigative journalists, whistleblowers, or other sources. These disclosures can expose the extent and nature of global surveillance activities, as well as the organizations and individuals involved in them. They can also highlight potential abuses or violations of laws or ethical standards related to surveillance.\n\n\n\nGlobal surveillance has been a controversial and divisive issue in recent years, with debates ongoing about the appropriate balance between national security and individual privacy. Disclosures about global surveillance activities can inform public discussions and debates about these issues, as well as prompt calls for reforms or changes in policy.<>wiki_csai
