Please explain what is \"Search tree\"<>In computer science, a search tree is a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. In order for a tree to function as a search tree, the key for each node must be greater than any keys in subtrees on the left, and less than any keys in subtrees on the right.\nThe advantage of search trees is their efficient search time given the tree is reasonably balanced, which is to say the leaves at either end are of comparable depths. Various search-tree data structures exist, several of which also allow efficient insertion and deletion of elements, which operations then have to maintain tree balance.\nSearch trees are often used to implement an associative array. The search tree algorithm uses the key from the key–value pair to find a location, and then the application stores the entire key–value pair at that particular location.<>A search tree is a data structure that is used to store a collection of items such that each item has a unique search key. The search tree is organized in such a way that it allows for efficient search and insertion of items. Search trees are commonly used in computer science and are an important data structure for many algorithms and applications.\n\n\n\nThere are several different types of search trees, each with its own specific characteristics and uses. Some common types of search trees include binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.\n\n\n\nIn a search tree, each node in the tree represents an item and has a search key associated with it. The search key is used to determine the position of the node in the tree. Each node also has one or more child nodes, which represent the items stored in the tree. The child nodes of a node are organized in a specific way, such that the search key of a node's child is either greater than or less than the search key of the parent node. This organization allows for efficient search and insertion of items in the tree.\n\n\n\nSearch trees are used in a wide variety of applications, including databases, file systems, and data compression algorithms. They are known for their efficient search and insertion capabilities, as well as their ability to store and retrieve data in a sorted manner.<>wiki_csai
