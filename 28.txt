how many died in hiroshima and nagasaki<>Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day.<>The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were two of the most devastating events in human history. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, killed an estimated 140,000 people, while the one dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, killed an estimated 74,000 people. These figures include both immediate deaths and deaths from radiation sickness and other injuries sustained in the bombings. It is estimated that up to 40% of the deaths in Hiroshima and up to 50% of the deaths in Nagasaki occurred within the first day of the bombings. The long-term effects of the bombings, including deaths from radiation exposure and other injuries, have continued to be felt in the years since the attacks.","In the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, tens of thousands of people were killed immediately, and many more died from injuries and radiation exposure in the weeks, months, and years that followed. It is difficult to accurately estimate the total number of casualties because of the destruction caused by the bombings and the difficulties in recording and documenting the deaths.\\n\\nAccording to the United States Department of Energy, an estimated 70,000 people were killed in the bombing of Hiroshima, and an estimated 40,000 people were killed in the bombing of Nagasaki. These numbers do not include the many people who died from injuries or radiation exposure in the weeks, months, and years following the bombings. The actual number of fatalities is likely higher, as these estimates do not account for individuals who were not counted in the official records, such as those who were unaccounted for or whose deaths were not reported.\\n\\nThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were major events in world history and had a profound impact on the course of World War II and the postwar world. The use of nuclear weapons has been controversial and remains a highly debated topic to this day.","The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II resulted in the deaths of an estimated 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 74,000 people in Nagasaki by the end of 1945. These figures include both military personnel and civilians. The bombings, which occurred on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, were carried out by the United States as part of the war effort against Japan. The bombs, which were dropped by aircraft, used nuclear fission to create a massive explosion that destroyed much of the city and caused widespread death and injury. The bombings led to Japan's surrender and the end of the war.<>open_qa
