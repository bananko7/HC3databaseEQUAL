If any kind of data can be represented by a string of numbers ( or , effectively , by one long number ) , how can anyone own a number ? I 'm referring to digital copyright law . Explain like I'm five.<>It 's the same as books . There are only 26 letters in the alphabet , but it takes time and effort to arrange the letters into something more meaningful than \" asÂ´kbvmepmvk \" . And people who to that have a copyright over their meaningful words .<>When we talk about someone \"owning\" a number, we usually mean that they have a legal right to control how that number is used or shared. This might include the right to reproduce the number, distribute copies of it, or publicly display it.\n\nIn the context of digital copyright law, the number itself is not what is being protected. Instead, it is the creative work that the number represents that is being protected. For example, if a musician creates a song and records it as a digital audio file, the digital audio file is a string of numbers that represents the song. The musician might have a copyright on the song, which gives them the exclusive right to control how the song is used and shared.\n\nIn this case, the musician does not own the string of numbers itself, but they do own the creative work (the song) that the numbers represent. This means that they have the right to control how the song is used and shared, even if it is represented as a string of numbers.\n\nI hope that helps to clarify things! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
