How does the bail system work in the USA ? if you ' post bail ' of $ 15,000 , say , do you get it back or what ? Do you get it back if the person was innocent or is it gone either way ? Please explain like I'm five.<>After you are arrested , the state wants a guarantee that you will show up for court . The \" bail \" money is used to coerce you into compliance . You get the money back when the case is disposed of , guilty or not , as long as you appear in court when you 're told . If you do n't show up , you have \" jumped bail \" and the cops and maybe Dog the bounty hunter will come looking for you .<>In the United States, the bail system works by allowing someone who has been arrested and charged with a crime to pay a certain amount of money, called bail, in order to be released from jail while they wait for their court case to be resolved. If the person pays the bail, they can go free until their court date. If they don't show up to court, they will lose the money they paid for bail. If the person is found not guilty, they will get the bail money back. If the person is found guilty, the bail money will be used to pay for any fines or fees associated with the case. So if the bail was $15,000 and the person is found guilty, they will not get the $15,000 back.<>reddit_eli5
