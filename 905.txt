How come candle \/ scent companies can nail a scent like cinnamon or honeysuckle , but scents like coastal waters or ocean breeze smell nothing like it ? Just got the national parks air wick plug in and it smells nothing like the channel islands . Please explain like I'm five.<>The first two you mention have essential oils that can be extracted so what you are smelling are those essential oils . I imagine something like \" Ocean Breeze \" or \" Midnight rain \" are just someone 's interpretation of what they smell like and a mixture of random oils to closely mimic the smell .<>Scent is a very subjective sense, and what one person associates with a particular smell may be different from what someone else associates with that same smell. Additionally, different scent products may use different methods to try to replicate a particular smell, and some methods may be more successful at capturing the desired scent than others. For example, some scents may be created using a blend of essential oils, while others may be created using synthetic fragrances. Additionally, the way that a scent is experienced can also be influenced by other factors such as an individual's sense of smell and the context in which the scent is being experienced.<>reddit_eli5
