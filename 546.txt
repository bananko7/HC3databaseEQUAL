Nothing to be panic. PERCOCET is a combination of paracetamol and oxycodone. It works nicely, you can take it. But along with this you have to take a course of antibiotics like penicillin. Do saline gargling. If the pain does not subside consult your dentist or oral physician.I hope my answer will help you, take care.<>Percocet is a prescription medication that combines acetaminophen and oxycodone.
