How can a space probe be guided or have it 's path corrected if there is 2 days of input lag ? Also , bonus for explaining how the probe tells earth it 's exact location in space accurate enough to be adjusted in the first place . Explain like I'm five. <>Without any friction in space , the movement of space probes is * very * predictable . Taking hours or days to make adjustments is n't that big of a deal , so long as you do a lot of math beforehand . Imagine driving cross country on a highway without any other cars . If you spend months planning , like they do for space missions , you could probably anticipate exactly where and when you needed to adjust your steering wheel , so that you could program all your movements in advance , and still keep the car on the road if it took a few minutes to change the plan . Space travel is kind of like that .<>Space probes are usually very far away from Earth, so it takes time for signals to travel back and forth between the probe and Earth. This means that there is often a delay, or lag, in the communication between the probe and Earth.\\n\\nTo guide a space probe, engineers on Earth can send commands to the probe telling it to make small adjustments to its trajectory, or path through space. These adjustments can help the probe reach its destination more accurately.\\n\\nTo know its exact location, a space probe uses a variety of sensors and instruments to measure its position and velocity. For example, it might use GPS (global positioning system) to determine its location relative to Earth. It might also use sensors to measure its speed and the direction it is moving.\\n\\nOnce the probe has measured its position and velocity, it can send this information back to Earth using radio waves. Engineers on Earth can then use this information to determine the probe's exact location and make any necessary adjustments to its path.\\n\\nOverall, guiding a space probe involves a combination of sending commands from Earth and using sensors and instruments on the probe to measure its position and make adjustments to its trajectory.<>reddit_eli5
