would someone please explain how a water tower works ? Where does the water come from ? How does it get up inside of it ? How long does it stay ? How is it dispersed ? Thanks in advance ! Explain like I'm five.<>Water tanks are a solution for the \" need constant water pressure \" problem . You have a pump , but it 's either on or off . When it 's on , it probably moves more water than the area is using so it would generate more pressure than the pipes can take if you just pumped water into the pipes . The solution , is to build a water tower . When the pump is on it pumps water into the tower . This makes the water level in the tower go up . When the tower is full , the pump turns off . Everybody always sees the pressure generated by the height of the tower above the pipes .<>\\nSure! A water tower is a large tank or container that holds water. Water towers are often tall and cylindrical, and they are usually made of metal or concrete.\\n\\nThe water in a water tower comes from a nearby source, such as a river, lake, or well. The water is pumped into the water tower using special pumps. These pumps can be powered by electricity, gasoline, or even steam.\\n\\nOnce the water is inside the water tower, it stays there until it is needed. When someone turns on a tap or a shower, the water in the water tower flows out and into the pipes that lead to your home or business.\\n\\nWater towers help make sure that there is enough water available for people to use, even if there is a drought or if there is a lot of demand for water. They also help to keep the water pressure high, so that the water flows out of the taps and showers with enough force.\\n\\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
