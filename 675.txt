How do we actually know that the Rosetta stone had correctly translated Hieroglyphics to Ancient Greek ? If it isnt \/ wasnt , would nt everything we deciphered be basically wrong ? Explain like I'm five.<>There was 3 languages initially discovered on it . We could understand 2 , and realized they said the same thing . We used that as a basis and assumed the third said the same thing in a different language ( which was hieroglyphics ) . It took 20 years pf studying after the initial discovery for people to believe they had translated it correctly .<>\\nThe Rosetta Stone is a large stone slab that was inscribed with writing in three different scripts: Ancient Greek, Demotic (a script used in ancient Egypt), and Hieroglyphics (the writing system of ancient Egypt). The Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799 and was instrumental in helping scholars to decipher hieroglyphics, which had been a mystery for centuries.\\n\\nTo determine if the translations on the Rosetta Stone were correct, scholars compared the translations to other texts and inscriptions written in Ancient Greek and hieroglyphics. They also used their knowledge of the languages and their grammar and syntax to verify that the translations were accurate.\\n\\nIn addition to these methods, scholars also used the stone itself as a reference. They studied the way the writing was carved into the stone and the style of the letters, which gave them clues about how the hieroglyphics were written and what they meant.\\n\\nOverall, scholars used a variety of methods to verify the translations on the Rosetta Stone and to determine that they were correct. While it is always possible that there may be errors in any translation, the translations on the Rosetta Stone have been widely accepted as accurate and have helped scholars to understand the meanings of hieroglyphics.\\n<>reddit_eli5
