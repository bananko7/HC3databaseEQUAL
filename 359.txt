Please explain what is \"Computational ethics\"<>Machine ethics (or machine morality, computational morality, or computational ethics) is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence concerned with adding or ensuring moral behaviors of man-made machines that use artificial intelligence, otherwise known as artificial intelligent agents. Machine ethics differs from other ethical fields related to engineering and technology.  Machine ethics should not be confused with computer ethics, which focuses on human use of computers. It should also be distinguished from the philosophy of technology, which concerns itself with the grander social effects of technology.<>Computational ethics is a field of study that deals with the ethical implications of the design, development, and use of computational systems and technologies. It examines the ethical issues that arise when computers and other forms of artificial intelligence are used to make decisions, gather and process information, and interact with humans.\n\n\n\nSome of the main issues in computational ethics include:\n\n\n\nPrivacy: How can we protect the privacy of individuals when personal information is collected and stored by computational systems?\n\nBias: How can we ensure that computational systems do not perpetuate or amplify biases that may exist in the data they are trained on or the algorithms they use?\n\nTransparency: How can we ensure that the decision-making processes of computational systems are transparent and explainable, so that users can understand how they work and why they produce certain results?\n\nAutonomy: How can we balance the autonomy of computational systems with the need for human oversight and control?\n\nComputational ethics is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a range of disciplines, including computer science, philosophy, law, and social science. It is a rapidly growing field, as the use of computational systems and technologies continues to expand and evolve.<>wiki_csai
