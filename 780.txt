Why do chains like Eddie Bauer and Jos A Banks open stores in airports ? How do they possibly make any money ? Many other chains too that I know do n't move enough product to afford the high rent of an airports space - especially behind security . Explain like I'm five.<>The great thing about a retail store at an airport , for a retailer , is they have a pretty consistent number of people who will show up and need to be at the airport for a certain amount of time . For many retailers , high rents are normal ( prime retail spaces downtown or in a thriving mall or other high traffic area is always expensive ) but most spaces ca n't guarantee a captive audience the way an airport can . [ This article ] ( URL_0 ) cites specialty retailers ( which covers most of the retail spaces ) in airports as generating nearly $ 1300 \/ square foot in annual sales , a close to triple the $ 400 revenue per square foot of mall retailers . Granted it 's a few years old , but given the struggles of shopping malls since then it 's unlikely that airports are doing worse than other shopping areas .<>\\nAirport stores are often able to charge higher prices for products than stores outside of airports because travelers may be more willing to pay a premium for convenience. In addition, airport stores may have a captive audience, as travelers may have limited options for places to shop once they are past security. Airport stores also have the advantage of being able to reach a diverse group of consumers from different locations. While the rent for an airport store may be higher than a store in a traditional retail location, the increased prices and potentially higher foot traffic can make it a worthwhile investment for some businesses.<>reddit_eli5
