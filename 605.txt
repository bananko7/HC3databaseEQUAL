Some of the footage was taken using cameras that were placed in fixed locations, such as on a tripod or mounted on a structure. This type of camera is often called a \"static\" camera.\\n\\nOther footage was taken using cameras that were carried by people, such as on their shoulders or in their hands. These cameras are often called \"handheld\" cameras.\\n\\nIn both cases, the cameras were carefully hidden or disguised so that the animals being filmed wouldn't be bothered by them. For example, the cameras might be camouflaged to blend in with the surroundings, or they might be placed inside a special container or housing that makes them look like something else.\\n\\nThe filmmakers also used special techniques to get close to the animals without disturbing them. For example, they might use a long lens to film from a distance, or they might use a special vehicle or boat to approach the animals slowly and carefully.\\n\\nOverall, it takes a lot of patience, skill, and knowledge to film animals in the wild in a way that is both beautiful and respectful.
