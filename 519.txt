Please explain what is \"Difference Engine\"<>A difference engine is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. It was designed in the 1820s, and was first created by Charles Babbage. The name, the difference engine, is derived from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial co-efficients. Some of the most common mathematical functions used in engineering, science and navigation, were, and still are computable with the use of the difference engine's capability of computing logarithmic and trigonometric functions, which can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers.<>The Difference Engine is a mechanical device that was designed and built in the early 19th century by Charles Babbage to automate the process of calculating and printing mathematical tables. Babbage's original design for the Difference Engine was never completed, but a later version of the machine, known as the Difference Engine No. 2, was constructed by the Science Museum in London in the 1990s based on Babbage's original plans.\n\n\n\nThe Difference Engine was intended to be a machine that could perform complex mathematical calculations and print out the results in the form of tables. It used a series of cog wheels and levers to perform arithmetic operations, and was driven by a series of punched cards similar to those used in early computers. The machine was designed to be able to calculate and print out tables of numbers with a high degree of accuracy, and was intended to be used in a variety of scientific and technical applications.\n\n\n\nDespite its advanced design, the Difference Engine was never widely used, due in part to the complexity of its construction and the difficulty of maintaining it. However, it remains an important early example of a machine that was designed to perform complex calculations, and is considered to be a precursor to the modern computer.<>wiki_csai
