Q. How to manage nosebleed?Hi doctor,My 3 year old daughter has had three nosebleeds in about 3 hours. During the nosebleeds, she said her cheek bone area close to her nose hurts. What to do?<>Hello. For further information consult a child health specialist online --> https:\/\/www.icliniq.com\/ask-a-doctor-online\/child-health-specialist<>Nosebleeds can be scary, especially for young children, but they are usually not serious and can be managed at home. Here are some steps you can take to manage your daughter's nosebleeds:\n\nHave her sit upright and lean slightly forward. This will help reduce the amount of blood that flows down the back of the throat, which can cause nausea or vomiting.\n\nHave her pinch the soft part of her nose just below the bony bridge. This will help to close off the blood vessels and stop the bleeding. Have her hold this position for at least 5-10 minutes.\n\nIf the bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes, you can try using a saline nasal spray or applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly inside the nostrils. This can help to moisturize the inside of the nostrils and reduce the likelihood of future nosebleeds.\n\nIf the bleeding continues or if your daughter experiences repeated nosebleeds, you should contact your healthcare provider. It's also a good idea to contact your healthcare provider if your daughter has any other symptoms, such as fever, headache, or facial pain.\n\nIn the meantime, try to keep the air in your home humid by using a humidifier or placing a bowl of water near a heat source. Dry air can contribute to nosebleeds.\n\nAvoid any activities that might irritate the inside of your daughter's nose, such as picking her nose or blowing her nose forcefully.\n\nI hope these suggestions help. If you have any further concerns or questions, don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider.<>medicine
