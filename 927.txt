High expense ratio funds - are they worth it?<>The 10 year comparison between your fund and the S&P 500 -   I'd say more, but not sure it's needed.<>Expense ratios are the fees that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) charge to cover their operating expenses. These fees are typically expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets and are deducted from the fund's returns. High expense ratio funds are those that charge higher fees compared to other similar funds.It's generally a good idea to try to minimize the expense ratios you pay on your investments, as they can eat into your returns over time. However, it's also important to consider the quality of the fund and the potential benefits it may offer in terms of performance and diversification.If a high expense ratio fund is able to deliver strong returns and meet your investment objectives, it may be worth it to pay the higher fees. On the other hand, if a low expense ratio fund offers similar returns and meets your investment goals, it may be a better choice.It's always a good idea to carefully review the fees and expenses associated with any investment before making a decision. It's also a good idea to consider the long-term impact of these fees on your investment returns, as well as your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.<>finance
