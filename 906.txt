It is all depends upon the lesion and which valve is affected and how severe is the condition, severe condition prognosis is very poor but it mild condition of valvular heart disease patient can complete the normal life span, clinical examination is the only way that could tell exactly about the prognosis. Hope I have answered your query, Let me know for further assistance.<>The prognosis for a person with leaky valves depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the leak, the specific valves involved, and the overall health of the person. It is not possible for me to provide a specific prognosis for your mother without knowing more about her individual case.\n\nIn general, however, leaky valves can potentially be managed with medications, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring by a healthcare provider. In some cases, surgery may be recommended to repair or replace the damaged valve. The decision about whether to pursue surgery will depend on the specific circumstances and will be made by your mother's healthcare team in consultation with her.\n\nIt is important to remember that every person is different and that the prognosis can vary widely. It is best to discuss your mother's specific situation with her healthcare provider, who can provide more information and guidance.<>medicine
