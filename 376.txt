It is important to see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment, as the infection can spread to other parts of the body and to other people if left untreated. In the meantime, you can try the following self-care measures to help manage the symptoms:\n\nKeep the affected area clean and dry. Wash the area with soap and water, and pat it dry with a clean towel.\n\nAvoid scratching the rash. This can cause the infection to spread and may lead to further irritation and inflammation.\n\nApply an over-the-counter antifungal cream or ointment to the affected area. This can help to kill the fungus and prevent the infection from spreading.\n\nUse a cool, damp cloth to help soothe the itchiness.\n\nAvoid tight clothing that may irritate the affected area. Wear loose-fitting clothing made of natural fibers, such as cotton.\n\nAvoid sharing personal items, such as towels, with others to prevent the infection from spreading.\n\nIt is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by your doctor to fully resolve the infection. This may include taking antifungal medication orally or applying an antifungal cream or ointment to the affected area for a period of time. If you have any concerns about your symptoms or treatment, be sure to speak with your doctor.<>medicine
