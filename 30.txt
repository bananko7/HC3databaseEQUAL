Why is it when you take a picture of an image on your computer monitor , the pictures always look funny with a lot of lines when you zoom in ? I know it has something to do with the screen and pixels , but not exactly sure . Explain like I'm five.<>close . it 's the refresh rates . what you see on a picture , that 's basically what your monitor is doing all the time . but really fast , so it looks like solid imagery to us .<>When you take a picture of an image on your computer monitor, the picture may appear strange or have a lot of lines when you zoom in because the image on your computer screen is made up of tiny pixels, which are small colored dots that form the image. When you take a picture of the screen with a camera, the camera's sensor also picks up these pixels and they can appear as lines or blocks in the picture, especially if you zoom in. This is because the camera's sensor does not have the same resolution as the screen, so it cannot capture all of the pixels in the image in the same level of detail.\r\n\r\nThink of it like this: imagine trying to draw a picture of a house using only big squares of color, like a mosaic. If you stood far away from the picture, it might look like a house, but if you got up close, you would be able to see the individual squares and the picture would not look as smooth. That's similar to what happens when you take a picture of an image on a computer screen: the image is made up of lots of tiny pixels, and when you zoom in, you can see the individual pixels more clearly.<>reddit_eli5
