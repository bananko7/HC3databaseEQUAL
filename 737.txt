How long should I keep an uncleared transaction in my checkbook?<>Why would you consider it null and void? It might be that something went wrong and the business \"lost\" the transaction one way or another. It might be something else. It might never appear. It might appear. In one of the questions a while ago someone posted a link of a story where an account was overdrawn because of a forgotten debit card charge that resurfaced months later. Can't find the link right now, but it can definitely happen.<>It's generally a good idea to keep track of uncleared transactions in your checkbook until they are cleared by your bank and reflected in your account balance. This will allow you to accurately track your spending and ensure that your checkbook balance accurately reflects the balance in your bank account.If you are using a physical checkbook, you can simply make a note in the checkbook next to the uncleared transaction, indicating that it has not yet been cleared. If you are using an electronic checkbook or personal financial management software, you can often mark transactions as \"uncleared\" or \"pending\" to indicate that they have not yet been cleared.It's also a good idea to regularly review your account statements or check your account online to verify that all transactions are accounted for and that your balance is accurate. This can help you identify any discrepancies or errors that may need to be addressed.<>finance
