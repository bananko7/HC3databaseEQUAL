When a Company was expected and then made a profit of X $ then that X$ increased it's share price. or those the Sellers and Buyers [duplicate]<>There are a few reason why share prices increase or decrease, the foremost is expectation of the investors that the company\/economy will do well\/not well, that is expectation of profit\/intrinsic value growth over some time frame (1-4 qtrs.)there is also demand & supply mismatch over (usually) short time. If you really see, the actual 'value' of a company is it's net-worth (cash+asset+stock in trade+brand value+other intangibles+other incomes)\/no of shares outstanding, which (in a way) is the book value, then all shares should trade at their book value, the actual number but it does not, the expectation of investors that a share would be purchased by another investor at a higher price because the outlook of the company over a long time is good.<>In general, when a company announces that it has made a profit, it can lead to an increase in the company's share price. This is because investors may see the profit as a sign that the company is financially healthy and doing well. As a result, more investors may be interested in buying the company's shares, which can lead to an increase in demand for the shares and a corresponding increase in the share price.However, it's important to note that there are many other factors that can affect a company's share price, including economic conditions, market trends, and the performance of other companies in the same industry. So while a profit announcement may contribute to an increase in the share price, it is not the only factor that can influence the price.<>finance
