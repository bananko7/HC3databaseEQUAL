Why is the 1\/4 mile stretch and 0 to 60 the benchmark cars are rated for ? What makes thoes the choice for rating cars ? Why ca n't we test on 0 - 100 or 1\/2 mile stretch ? Explain like I'm five.<>The European standard for measuring acceleration is the time for 0 - 100 * kilometers * per hour . This is converts to about 0 - 62 mph which was then rounded down , so both numbers are very similar and can be easily compared . The quarter mile seems to come from quarter horse racing ( [ source ] ( URL_0 ) ) , but I figure that this is just a good distance that is not too short ( cars do n't reach max speed ) and not too long ( difficult to find , cars drive max speed for the majority of the track ) .<>The 1\/4 mile and 0 to 60 mph benchmarks are commonly used to rate cars because they are easy to measure and compare, and they give a good indication of a car's performance. The 1\/4 mile distance is about the length of a drag strip, which is a special type of track that is designed specifically for racing cars. It's a good distance to use because it's long enough to show how fast a car can accelerate, but not so long that it takes too long to complete.\n\nThe 0 to 60 mph benchmark is also a good way to measure a car's acceleration, because it's a widely recognized standard. It measures how quickly a car can go from a standing start to 60 mph, which is a common speed on highways.\n\nIt's possible to test cars on other distances or speeds, but the 1\/4 mile and 0 to 60 mph benchmarks are widely accepted and understood, so they are often used as a way to compare the performance of different cars.<>reddit_eli5
