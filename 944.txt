Please explain what is \"Wake-sleep algorithm\"<>The wake-sleep algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm for a stochastic multilayer[clarification needed] neural network. The algorithm adjusts the parameters so as to produce a good density estimator. There are two learning phases, the “wake” phase and the “sleep” phase, which are performed alternately. It was first designed as a model for brain functioning using variational Bayesian learning. After that, the algorithm was adapted to machine learning. It can be viewed as a way to train a Helmholtz Machine. It can also be used in Deep Belief Networks (DBN).<>The wake-sleep algorithm is a machine learning method that is used to train deep neural networks with multiple layers of hidden units. It was introduced in 1995 by Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues at the University of Toronto.\n\n\n\nThe basic idea behind the wake-sleep algorithm is to use two neural networks, called the \"generative\" network and the \"recognition\" network, to learn a model of the data distribution. The generative network is trained to generate samples from the data distribution, while the recognition network is trained to recognize the generated samples as being drawn from the data distribution.\n\n\n\nDuring the \"wake\" phase of the algorithm, the generative network is used to generate samples from the data distribution, and the recognition network is used to evaluate the likelihood of these samples being drawn from the data distribution. During the \"sleep\" phase, the recognition network is used to generate samples from the data distribution, and the generative network is used to evaluate the likelihood of these samples being drawn from the data distribution.\n\n\n\nBy alternating between the wake and sleep phases, the two networks can be trained to learn a good model of the data distribution. The wake-sleep algorithm has been shown to be effective at training deep neural networks and has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of machine learning tasks.<>wiki_csai
