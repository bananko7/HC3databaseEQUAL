What causes pain in shoulder and arm with numbness in hand?I am a large woman of 50 - I have experienced pain in my right shoulder and arm - have numbness in my hand - have lost some strength to my hand and am plagued by pins and needles this has been going on since early August (3 months)- I have had physio therapy but this only provides temporary relief...... I have seen a show on MND and am starting to worry - although there is no history of this in my family<>Hello,Your symptoms are not typical of MND. Instead, they are more suggestive of a pinched nerve or a bulging disc in the neck. For this reason, I recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam and performing a cervical spine X-ray study and nerve conduction studies.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist<>There are several possible causes of shoulder and arm pain with numbness in the hand, including:\n\nPinched nerve: This can occur when a nerve in the shoulder, arm, or hand becomes compressed or squeezed, leading to numbness and tingling.\n\nShoulder impingement syndrome: This is a condition that occurs when the tendons or bursae (small fluid-filled sacs) in the shoulder become compressed, causing pain and numbness in the arm and hand.\n\nCervical radiculopathy: This is a condition that occurs when a nerve in the neck becomes pinched or compressed, leading to pain, numbness, and weakness in the arm and hand.\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome: This is a condition that occurs when the nerves or blood vessels in the upper chest become compressed, leading to pain, numbness, and weakness in the arm and hand.\n\nMultiple sclerosis: This is a neurological condition that can cause muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling in the arms, legs, and other parts of the body.\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome: This is a condition that occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, becomes compressed, leading to numbness and tingling in the hand and fingers.\n\nIt's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. While motor neuron disease (MND) could be a potential cause of these symptoms, it is just one possibility and there are many other potential causes. Your healthcare provider will be able to determine the specific cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.<>medicine
