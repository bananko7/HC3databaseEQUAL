Why are we all mad at EA Games ? I can never seem to express this opinion in words . I just know I 'm supposed to be mad as hell . Explain like I'm five.<>I ca n't speak for all EA games but they completely eliminated all competition with Madden by buying the exclusive rights to the NFL rosters , completely eliminating NFL 2k games , which were $ 19.99 I might add . With this exclusive license , they can make whatever crap they want with 0 competition .<>EA Games is a video game company that has made many popular games, but some people are unhappy with some of the things the company has done. Some people feel that EA Games charges too much money for certain things in their games, such as microtransactions (which are small purchases that players can make to unlock certain items or features in a game). Others are unhappy with the way EA Games has handled certain aspects of their games, such as bugs or other technical issues. Some people also feel that EA Games puts profits before the enjoyment of their players. These are some of the reasons why some people are unhappy with EA Games. It's important to remember that not everyone feels this way, and it's okay to have your own opinion about a company or its products.<>reddit_eli5
