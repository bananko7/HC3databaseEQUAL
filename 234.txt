Please explain what is \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\"<>A.I. Artificial Intelligence (also known as A.I.) is a 2001 American science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson were based on the 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" by Brian Aldiss. The film was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg, and Bonnie Curtis. It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson, and William Hurt. Set in a futuristic post-climate change society, A.I. tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.\nDevelopment of A.I. originally began after producer\/director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt that computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay and dedicated the film to Kubrick.\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence was released on June 29, 2001, in North America by Warner Bros. Pictures and internationally by DreamWorks Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed approximately $235 million against a budget of $90â€“100 million. It was also nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score (for John Williams) at the 74th Academy Awards. In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics around the world, A.I. Artificial Intelligence was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000.<>\"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (also known simply as \"A.I.\") is a science fiction film released in 2001.
