Why our body needs a substance ? Like heroin for example . I 'm more interested in alcohol thoug . Please explain like I'm five.<>Your brain has certain \" happy \" chemicals that get released everytime something good happens , like when you eat nice food , have sex , win a game , etc . Drugs mimic those chemicals . The brain sees those chemicals and thinks , ' oh well , that 's nice ' . But over a long time , the brain adapts and thinks ' hey , I get those chemicals for free all the time , I do n't even need to produce them myself , they 're expensive anyways ' , so it stops and relies on the drugs to be happy . It learns what to do to get them , and makes you want to get them . Then , when you quit cold turkey , the brain is confused and messed up , because it needs to rebalance itself . ' Where 's the happy stuff ? Get me more happy stuff . aaaw , do I have to do it myself ? Come on ! ' The great strength of the brain is learning , but when it learns to rely on things that destroy it 's chemical balance and potentially it 's life , that 's where it gets dangerous .<>Our bodies don't actually need substances like alcohol or heroin. These substances can have negative effects on our bodies and can be harmful to our health. Alcohol is a depressant, which means it can slow down the functions of the body and the brain. It can also lead to addiction and other problems when used in excess. It's important to drink alcohol in moderation and to be aware of the risks associated with its use. It's also important to remember that it's never safe to use drugs like heroin, as they can be extremely dangerous and addictive. It's always best to talk to a doctor or another trusted healthcare professional if you have questions about substance use and its effects on the body.<>reddit_eli5
