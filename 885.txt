Why did Discovery Channel and National Geopraphic stop making scientific shows , but instead those crappy shows where you watch rednecks make money ? It really bothers me , since 80%-90 % of their shows are about rednecks making money , someone flipping cars or surviving in Alaska . Please explain like I'm five.<>Money . More people want to watch that than actual scientific programming . Do n't blame the companies , blame the consumers .<>I'm sorry, but I am not aware of any changes in programming at Discovery Channel or National Geographic. It is possible that the content you are seeing is simply a temporary programming shift or that your viewing habits have changed and you are now more likely to tune in to those types of shows. It is also possible that you are remembering the past differently than it actually was and that these channels have always had a mix of programming, including both scientific and non-scientific shows. I would recommend trying to watch a variety of different programs on these channels to get a better understanding of their overall content offerings.<>reddit_eli5
