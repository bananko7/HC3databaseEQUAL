Given the amount of lint that comes out of the dryer , are my clothes slowly disintegrating with time ? Would they eventually disappear completely ? Sometimes the sheet of lint that comes out feels pretty substantial . It 's surely a non - negligible amount of fabric . Please explain like I'm five.<>Yes , the intense heat and friction in dryers causes the fibers in your clothes to shed their external layer . This is why pants or bedsheets become shiny - looking over time , and also why the lower back of hoodies and tee shirts ( where fabric rubs against chairs or backpacks ) begin to form pills , or little balls of lint . This is why air - drying increases the longevity of your clothing .<>No, your clothes are not slowly disintegrating with time. Lint is just small bits of fibers that come off of fabrics during the drying process. These fibers can come from a variety of sources, such as towels, blankets, and clothing. Lint is not a sign that your clothes are falling apart or disappearing. It's normal for some lint to come off of fabrics when they are being dried, especially if they are made of natural fibers like cotton or wool. This is because these fibers are more prone to shedding than synthetic fibers like polyester or nylon. So, while it might seem like a lot of lint is coming out of your dryer, it's actually just a small amount of fibers that have come off of your clothes and other fabrics. Your clothes are not disintegrating and will not disappear completely.<>reddit_eli5
