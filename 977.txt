When to hire an investment professional?<>Lifecycle funds might be a suitable fit for you. Lifecycle funds (aka \"target date funds\") are a mutual fund that invests your money in other mutual funds based on how much time is left until you need the money-- they follow a \"glide-path\" of reducing stock holdings in favor of bonds over time to reduce volatility of your final return as you near retirement.  The ones I've looked at don't charge a fee of their own for this, but they do direct your portfolio to actively managed funds. That said, the ones I've seen have an \"acquired\" expense ratio of less than what you're proposing you'd pay a professional. FWIW, my current plan is to invest in a binary portfolio of cheap mutual funds that track S&P500 and AGG and rebalance regularly. This is easy enough that I don't see the point of adding in a 1 percent commission.<>It can be helpful to hire an investment professional if you are new to investing and want guidance on how to create a portfolio that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. An investment professional can also be helpful if you have a complex financial situation or if you have a high net worth and want to ensure that your assets are managed in a way that is tax-efficient and aligned with your long-term financial objectives.Additionally, hiring an investment professional can be beneficial if you don't have the time or expertise to manage your own investments. Investment professionals, such as financial advisors or wealth managers, can help you research and select investments, monitor your portfolio, and make changes as needed to help you achieve your financial goals.It's important to note that hiring an investment professional comes with a cost, which can include fees for their services as well as potential commissions on the products they recommend. It's important to carefully consider the costs and benefits of hiring an investment professional and to do your due diligence in selecting a professional who is well-suited to meet your needs.<>finance
