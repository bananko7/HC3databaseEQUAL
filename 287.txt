Should I really pay off my entire credit card balance each month or should I maintain some balance?<>Always pay on time, and stop listening to whoever is telling you not to -- they are clueless. Credit cards are revolving accounts with a grace period. The balance owed is due on the statement date, and you have a grace period of 20-40 days to pay.  Paying bills on time is the single most important thing that you can do to have a good credit score. Always pay on time.<>It is generally recommended to pay off your entire credit card balance each month if possible. This is because credit cards typically have high interest rates, and carrying a balance from month to month can result in significant interest charges. Additionally, maintaining a high balance on your credit card can negatively impact your credit score, as it can be seen as a sign of financial strain.On the other hand, if you are able to pay off your balance in full each month and do so consistently, it can be beneficial for your credit score. This is because paying your balance in full and on time each month demonstrates responsible credit use and can help improve your credit score over time.It's also important to note that if you are having difficulty paying off your credit card balance in full each month, it may be a good idea to consider ways to reduce your spending or increase your income in order to better manage your finances. If you are unable to pay off your balance in full, it is generally recommended to at least pay more than the minimum due in order to avoid accruing additional interest and to pay down your debt more quickly.<>finance
