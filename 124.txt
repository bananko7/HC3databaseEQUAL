Please explain what is \"Glial cells\"<>Glia, also called glial cells (gliocytes) or neuroglia, are non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system that do not produce electrical impulses. They maintain homeostasis, form myelin in the peripheral nervous system, and provide support and protection for neurons. In the central nervous system, glial cells include oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglia, and in the peripheral nervous system they include Schwann cells and satellite cells.<>Glial cells, also known as glia or neuroglia, are non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). They are found in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, and they play a variety of roles in the nervous system.\n\n\n\nThere are several types of glial cells, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and Schwann cells. Each type of glial cell has a specific function, but they all work together to support and protect the neurons in the nervous system.\n\n\n\nAstrocytes are one of the most abundant types of glial cells in the brain. They provide structural support for neurons and help to maintain the blood-brain barrier, which separates the blood from the brain tissue. Astrocytes also help to regulate the chemical environment around neurons by removing excess neurotransmitters from the synapses (the spaces between neurons) and helping to replenish them when needed.\n\n\n\nOligodendrocytes are glial cells that produce myelin, a fatty substance that insulates axons (the long, thin projections of neurons) and helps to speed the transmission of nerve impulses. Myelin is essential for normal brain function, and damage to it can lead to disorders such as multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n\nMicroglia are small, phagocytic cells that are important for immune defense in the CNS. They help to protect the brain and spinal cord from infection and inflammation by detecting and removing damaged cells and foreign substances.\n\n\n\nSchwann cells are glial cells that are found in the PNS. They produce myelin and play a similar role in the peripheral nerves as oligodendrocytes do in the CNS.\n\n\n\nOverall, glial cells play a critical role in the function and health of the nervous system. They support and protect neurons, and they help to maintain the chemical and structural environment necessary for proper brain function.<>wiki_csai
