There are a number of possible causes for a swollen inner cheek with peeling skin and tenderness, including:\n\nOral infection: A bacterial or fungal infection in your mouth, such as a staph infection or thrush, could cause these symptoms.\n\nAllergic reaction: You may be experiencing an allergic reaction to something you've eaten or come into contact with. This could cause swelling and irritation in your cheek.\n\nPhysical trauma: If you've accidentally bitten your cheek or experienced some other kind of physical trauma to your mouth, this could cause swelling and tenderness.\n\nDry mouth: If you have dry mouth, your cheeks may become swollen and peeling due to the lack of moisture in your mouth.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor or dentist to determine the cause of your symptoms and get proper treatment. In the meantime, you can try using a warm saltwater rinse to help clean your mouth and reduce inflammation. Avoid eating spicy or acidic foods that may further irritate your cheek.<>medicine
