Please explain what is \"Imperfect information\"<>In economics, perfect information (sometimes referred to as \"no hidden information\") is a feature of perfect competition. With perfect information in a market, all consumers and producers have complete and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, their own utility, and own cost functions.\nIn game theory, a sequential game has perfect information if each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, including the \"initialization event\" of the game (e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game).\nPerfect information is importantly different from complete information, which implies common knowledge of each player's utility functions, payoffs, strategies and \"types\". A game with perfect information may or may not have complete information.\nGames where some aspect of play is hidden from opponents - such as the cards in poker and bridge - are examples of games with imperfect information.<>Imperfect information refers to a situation in which one or more players in a game or decision-making process do not have complete information about the options available to them or the consequences of their actions. In other words, the players do not have a complete understanding of the situation and must make decisions based on incomplete or limited information.\n\n\n\nThis can occur in various settings, such as in strategic games, economics, and even in everyday life. For example, in a game of poker, players do not know what cards the other players have and must make decisions based on the cards they can see and the actions of the other players. In the stock market, investors do not have complete information about the future performance of a company and must make investment decisions based on incomplete data. In everyday life, we often have to make decisions without having complete information about all of the potential outcomes or the preferences of the other people involved.\n\n\n\nImperfect information can lead to uncertainty and complexity in decision-making processes and can have significant impacts on the outcomes of games and real-world situations. It is an important concept in game theory, economics, and other fields that study decision-making under uncertainty.<>wiki_csai
