How effective were the zero fighter planes in world war II Just wondering how effective the planes were , in regard to how much damage they inflicted . Thanks in advance for any answers Explain like I'm five.<>I 'm not sure how much damage the fighters did overall , exactly . The fighters were extremely well designed and constructed , though . Expert engineering . Aerodynamic as a bird in flight , and about half the weight of the American equivalents . The wiki entry probably has more useful info than I can give .<>The Zero fighter plane, also known as the Mitsubishi A6M, was a Japanese aircraft used in World War II. It was very effective in the early part of the war, particularly in the Pacific Theater. The Zero was known for its high speed, long range, and agility, which made it difficult for other planes to shoot it down. It was also well-armed, with two 20mm cannons and two 7.7mm machine guns.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the war went on and other countries developed better planes, the Zero became less effective. It was not as heavily armored as some other planes, so it was more vulnerable to damage. It also didn't have as much firepower as some of the newer planes that were being developed.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Zero was a very effective plane in the early part of World War II, but it became less effective as the war went on and other countries developed better planes.<>reddit_eli5
