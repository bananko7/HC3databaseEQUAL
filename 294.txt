Please explain what is \"Vision processing unit\"<>A vision processing unit (VPU) is (as of 2018) an emerging class of microprocessor; it is a specific type of AI accelerator, designed to accelerate machine vision tasks.<>A vision processing unit (VPU) is a specialized hardware device that is designed to accelerate the process of analyzing and interpreting visual data. It is often used in conjunction with a computer's central processing unit (CPU) to perform tasks related to image and video processing, such as object recognition, image classification, and facial recognition. VPUs are commonly found in a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, security systems, and other devices that rely on visual data for their operation.\n\n\n\nVPUs are designed to be highly efficient at performing complex calculations and processing large amounts of data in real-time, which makes them well-suited for tasks that require fast processing of visual information. They typically include specialized hardware components, such as image sensors, dedicated memory, and processing cores, that are optimized for handling visual data. Some VPUs are also designed to support machine learning algorithms, which allows them to learn and adapt to new data over time.\n\n\n\nIn summary, a VPU is a hardware device that is used to accelerate the process of analyzing and interpreting visual data, and it is commonly found in applications that rely on visual data for their operation.<>wiki_csai
