What causes excessive breathing in the baby?Hello, I have a 4 1\/2 month old baby who is breathing at 72 breaths per minute resting. She was 38weeks at delivery and, while small (2.75 kg) was pretty good for a twin. Her growth is fine and development normal. I am just concerned about breath rate as our 3 year old has bronchiolitis obliterans and is oxygen dependent. I think we did not diagnose her problems early enough. Any advice?<>Hello, By what you say this seems to be a medical emergency to me. The baby's respiratory rate requires hospitalization and evaluation. It could be acute bronchiolitis, please take her to the nearest Emergency Room as soon as possible. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Sumanth Amperayani, Pediatrician, Pulmonology<>It is not uncommon for infants to have relatively fast breathing rates compared to adults. In general, a normal respiratory rate for an infant is between 30 and 60 breaths per minute. However, there are certain conditions that can cause an infant to have an increased respiratory rate, such as:\n\nInfections: Respiratory infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, can cause an infant to have an increased respiratory rate.\n\nAllergies: Allergic reactions can cause inflammation in the airways and lead to an increased respiratory rate.\n\nCongenital heart defects: Some infants are born with heart defects that can cause an increased respiratory rate.\n\nPrematurity: Infants who are born prematurely may have an increased respiratory rate due to underdeveloped respiratory muscles.\n\nIt is important to monitor your baby's respiratory rate and seek medical attention if you are concerned. A healthcare provider will be able to assess your baby's breathing and determine the cause of any abnormalities. It is also important to make sure your baby is up to date on all recommended vaccinations, as some vaccines can help protect against respiratory infections.<>medicine
