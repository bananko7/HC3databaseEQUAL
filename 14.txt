Please explain what is \"Conditional independence\"<>In probability theory, conditional independence describes situations wherein an observation is irrelevant or redundant when evaluating the certainty of a hypothesis. Conditional independence is usually formulated in terms of conditional probability, as a special case where the probability of the hypothesis given the uninformative observation is equal to the probability without. If \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n is the hypothesis, and \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n and \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n are observations, conditional independence can be stated as an equality:\nwhere \n\n\n\nP\n(\nA\n∣\nB\n,\nC\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P(A\\mid B,C)}\n\n is the probability of \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n given both \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n and \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n. Since the probability of \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n given \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n is the same as the probability of \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n given both \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n and \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n, this equality expresses that \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n contributes nothing to the certainty of \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n. In this case, \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n and \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n are said to be conditionally independent given \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n, written symbolically as: \n\n\n\n(\nA\n⊥\n\n\n\n⊥\nB\n∣\nC\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (A\\perp \\!\\!\\!\\perp B\\mid C)}\n\n.\nThe concept of conditional independence is essential to graph-based theories of statistical inference, as it establishes a mathematical relation between a collection of conditional statements and a graphoid.<>Conditional independence is a statistical concept that refers to the absence of a relationship between two variables, given the value of a third variable. In other words, if we know the value of the third variable, the presence or absence of a relationship between the other two variables does not change.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a study on the relationship between income and education level. The relationship between these two variables might be strong - that is, people with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes. However, if we introduce a third variable, such as race, into the analysis, the relationship between income and education level might become weaker or disappear altogether. This is because race could be a confounding variable that influences both income and education level. In this case, we would say that income and education level are conditionally independent given race.\n\n\n\nConditional independence can be useful for statistical modeling and data analysis, as it allows us to identify and control for confounding variables that might influence the relationships between other variables. It can also be used to simplify statistical models by eliminating unnecessary variables and assumptions.<>wiki_csai
