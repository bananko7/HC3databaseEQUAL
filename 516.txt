It is inherited condition and it is in her genes. Unfortunately, it cannot be reversed by any cream or oral medication. However, it can be improved with oral Retinoids and topical Emollients.

I can understand your concern.<>Ichthyosis hystrix, also known as \"hystrix-like ichthyosis,\" is a rare genetic skin condition that is characterized by thick, rough, and scaly skin on the arms, legs, and torso. It can also affect the scalp, face, and nails.
