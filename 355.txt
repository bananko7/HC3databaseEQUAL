How do police trace bullets back to the gun they were shot from ? Or is this something you only see on tv ? Explain like I'm five. <>You 're getting some good explanations as to the theory , but keep one thing in mind ; it does n't always work as well as the theory suggests . Wear and tear from normal use of a firearm changes the patterns left on cartridge pieces that might be used to identify the firearm . The firing pin could leave different marks after another 1000 rounds have been fired , likewise with marks on the bullet from the barrel . Also , markings on casings or bullets are n't like DNA . There is no actual proof that they are always 100 % unique . It comes down to degrees of probability . Two models of the exact same pistol for instance , only one number apart in their serial number , meaning they were manufactured one after another , could very well have extremely similar imperfections on the moving surfaces . If they are purchased around the same time , have roughly the same number of rounds through them , and both use the most popular brands of ammunition , there is a good chance the markings on the barrel or firing pin will be pretty similar . Is it similar enough to rule out a different gun ? How likely is it that the person who bought the very next gun off the assemble line committed the crime you 're accused of with the same gun you own ? Well that 's for the attorneys to argue about and for the jury to decide . But it 's not a perfect science , and it 's far from absolute proof .<>Tracing a bullet back to the gun it was shot from is a process called \"ballistic fingerprinting.\" It's something that can be done in real life, but it's not as simple as it might seem on TV.\\n\\nHere's how it works:\\n\\nWhen a gun is fired, the bullet leaves the barrel of the gun and travels through the air. The gun also leaves behind certain markings on the bullet, called \"lands and grooves.\" These markings are unique to each gun and are caused by the barrel of the gun as the bullet passes through it.\\n\\nWhen the bullet is found at a crime scene, it can be collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\\n\\nIn the laboratory, the bullet is examined under a microscope to look at the lands and grooves.\\n\\nThe lands and grooves are then compared to a database of known firearms to see if there is a match.\\n\\nIf there is a match, it means that the bullet was likely fired from the same gun that is in the database. This can help investigators determine which gun was used in the crime.\\n\\nIt's important to note that ballistic fingerprinting is not a perfect science. There are many factors that can affect the markings on a bullet, such as the type of gun, the type of ammunition, and even the environment in which the gun was fired. This means that it is possible for there to be more than one gun that matches the bullet's markings.\\n\\nI hope that helps to explain how ballistic fingerprinting works! Is there anything else you would like to know?<>reddit_eli5
