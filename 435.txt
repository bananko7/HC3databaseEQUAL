how the hell does this pay - to - play pool table know whether or not you scratched ? The cue ball gets returned to you , but other balls do n't . Is it a size thing ? Explain like I'm five.<>It could sort by size , or perhaps by weight . If the cue ball is slightly smaller than the others , there would be a hole just big enough for the cue ball along the chute that the balls travel . If it 's a weight difference , the cue ball would either be lighter ( and thus not open a barrier that other balls do , thus redirecting the cue ball in a different path ) , or heavier ( thus opening said barrier , while other balls do not ) .<>Some pool tables have sensors that can detect when a ball goes into a pocket or touches a cushion. These sensors can also detect if a ball has left the table entirely. When the cue ball is returned to the player after a scratch, it's because the sensors on the table detected that the cue ball left the table or went into a pocket. The other balls may not be returned to the player because they are still on the table and can be used for the next shot. It's not a size thing, it's just the way the sensors on the table are programmed to work.<>reddit_eli5
