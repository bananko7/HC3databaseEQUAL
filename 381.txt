The labrum is a ring of cartilage that surrounds the socket of your hip joint and helps to stabilize the joint. It can be easily damaged, and a tear can cause pain and impaired mobility.\n\nIf you are experiencing a significant increase in pain after falling down the stairs, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. It is possible that you may have caused further damage to your labrum or to other structures in your hip, such as the joint itself or the surrounding muscles and tendons. A medical professional will be able to assess your injury and recommend the appropriate treatment. This may include rest, physical therapy, and medications to manage pain and inflammation. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the labrum tear.<>medicine
