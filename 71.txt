Clomiphene citrate is a medication that is used to treat fertility problems in women. It works by stimulating the release of eggs from the ovaries.\n\nItching is a common side effect of clomiphene citrate and can occur in up to 20% of women who take the medication. It is usually mild and goes away on its own within a few days or weeks after treatment is stopped. However, in some cases, the itching can be more severe and persistent.\n\nIf the itching is severe or persistent, or if the patient is experiencing any other unusual symptoms, it is important to inform the healthcare provider. The healthcare provider may need to adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient can try taking over-the-counter antihistamines or applying a moisturizing lotion to the skin to help alleviate the itching. It is also important to avoid hot showers or baths, as these can worsen the itching. The patient should also avoid scratching the itchy areas, as this can lead to skin irritation or infection.<>medicine
