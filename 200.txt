I 'm going to assume you come from an Anglophone country which would also have a culture of picking on the French .<>It is not accurate to say that France is \"picked on\" for surrendering during World War II. Surrender is a common aspect of warfare, and it is not uncommon for countries to surrender when they are unable to continue fighting or when the cost of continuing to fight is too high. \nDuring World War II, France was one of the major powers that was part of the Allied powers, which also included countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. France was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, and after a series of battles, the French government was forced to sign an armistice with Germany, which effectively ended the fighting between the two countries. \nIt is important to remember that the decision to surrender is often a difficult one that is made by governments and military leaders, and it is not meant to be taken lightly. Surrendering can be seen as a way to protect the lives and well-being of the people in the country, and it can also be a way to end a conflict that has caused a lot of suffering and destruction. In the case of France during World War II, the decision to surrender was likely made in order to try to protect the people of France and to avoid further loss of life.<>reddit_eli5
