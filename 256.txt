Nexito cantain escitalopram and it is SSRI. It is ggood medicine for anxiety and depression. If she has response and ddo not have side effect then need to take medicines Regularaly. Do take advise from your treating doctor. It will take time to show response. Still if you have a query then feel free to ask. Happy to help you. Thank you.<>I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's struggles with psychiatric problems. It is important to note that psychiatric medications can be very effective in treating a variety of mental health conditions, but they can also have side effects. If your daughter is experiencing significant side effects from the Nexito medication, it is important to speak with her healthcare provider. The healthcare provider may be able to adjust the dose of the medication or prescribe a different medication that is better tolerated.\n\nIt is not appropriate for me to recommend a specific alternative medication without knowing more about your daughter's specific condition, medical history, and other medications she may be taking. It is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by her healthcare provider, as they are the most qualified to determine the best course of treatment for her specific needs.<>medicine
