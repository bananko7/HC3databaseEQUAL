If a plane cabin is pressurized , why do our ears pop ? Should n't there be no difference in pressure , hence no pop ? Explain like I'm five.<>They are at higher pressure than cruising altitude but lower pressure than on the ground . This is a balance of cost in maintaining a higher pressure within the aircraft .<>\\nWhen a plane is flying at high altitudes, the air inside the cabin is pressurized to help us breathe and feel comfortable. However, when the plane is ascending or descending, the cabin pressure can change. This change in pressure can cause the air inside your middle ear to expand or contract. The eustachian tube, which is a small passageway in your ear, helps to equalize the pressure on both sides of your eardrum. When the pressure changes, the eustachian tube can open and close to let air in or out of your middle ear, which can cause a \"popping\" sensation. So, even though the cabin is pressurized, the pressure can still change during the flight and cause your ears to pop. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
