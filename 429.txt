Please explain what is \"Computer-assisted diagnosis\"<>Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.\nCAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.\nCAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.\nComputer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.\nAlthough CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.<>Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) is a type of medical diagnosis that uses computer algorithms and other technology to analyze data and provide a diagnosis or recommendation. It can be used to analyze a variety of data sources, such as medical images, laboratory test results, and patient records. The goal of CAD is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnosis by providing a second opinion or by assisting doctors in making a diagnosis.\n\n\n\nThere are many different applications of CAD in medicine, including:\n\n\n\nAnalysis of medical images: CAD systems can be used to analyze medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, to identify abnormalities or diagnose conditions.\n\n\n\nLaboratory test analysis: CAD systems can be used to analyze laboratory test results, such as blood tests and tissue samples, to identify abnormalities or diagnose conditions.\n\n\n\nElectronic health record analysis: CAD systems can be used to analyze patient records, including medical history, family history, and other relevant information, to identify trends or potential health issues.\n\n\n\nPredictive analytics: CAD systems can be used to analyze data from multiple sources to predict the likelihood of certain health outcomes or to identify potential risk factors for certain conditions.\n\n\n\nCAD systems are not meant to replace doctors, but rather to assist them in making more accurate and efficient diagnoses. They are often used as a second opinion or to help confirm a diagnosis, and they can be especially helpful in cases where a diagnosis is difficult to make or where multiple conditions may be present.<>wiki_csai
