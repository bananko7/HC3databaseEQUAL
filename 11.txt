Q. I have tooth pain with swollen gums for the past 3 days. Please suggest solution.Hello doctor,I have been experiencing tooth pain and mild gum swelling for the last two to three days. It is paining a lot and I am unable to eat food too. Kindly suggest remedies. I am consuming Rajnigandha (pan masala) for the last two years, have reduced the consumption since pain is there.<>Hello. I suggest some medicines, but please stop the consumption of Rajnigandha immediately. Do not take spicy and hot food. Take tablet Augmentin 625 (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) twice daily, Zerodol SP (Aceclofenac, Paracetamol, and Serratiopeptidase) twice daily, Hexigel ointment (for topical application) all medicine for three days. If you have any drug allergy history or allergy please consult your physician before taking medicine. Follow up after three days.<>Tooth pain and swollen gums can be caused by a variety of factors, including tooth decay, gum disease, abscesses, and mouth infections. It is important to see a dental professional as soon as possible to determine the cause of your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try some home remedies to help manage your pain:\n\nRinse your mouth with warm salt water to reduce swelling and kill bacteria.\n\nTake over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help relieve the pain.\n\nAvoid eating or drinking anything that is very hot or cold, as this can worsen the pain.\n\nAvoid eating hard, crunchy, or chewy foods that may irritate your gums.\n\nApply a cold compress to the outside of your cheek to help reduce swelling.\n\nAvoid tobacco and alcohol, as these can irritate your gums and worsen the pain.\n\nIt is also important to practice good oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing regularly, to help prevent future dental problems. If your symptoms persist or worsen, you should see a dental professional as soon as possible.<>medicine
