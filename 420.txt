If they were suspended for the next match then I would watch more .<>FIFA, which is the governing body for soccer (also known as football) around the world, does not fine players for flopping in the same way that the NBA fines basketball players for flopping. Flopping is when a player falls to the ground or exaggerates the impact of a play in an attempt to deceive the referee into thinking that a foul has been committed. In soccer, flopping is generally not as prevalent as it is in basketball because the rules of the game are different. In soccer, players are not allowed to use their hands to touch the ball (with the exception of the goalkeeper within the penalty area), so it is more difficult for players to create contact with each other. Additionally, soccer referees are generally more lenient when it comes to fouls and are more likely to let play continue rather than blowing the whistle and stopping the game. However, that being said, flopping is still considered unsportsmanlike behavior in soccer and can result in disciplinary action being taken against a player, such as a yellow or red card. The rules and regulations for disciplining players in soccer are generally left up to the individual leagues and tournaments, so it is possible that some leagues or tournaments may have stricter penalties for flopping than others.<>reddit_eli5
