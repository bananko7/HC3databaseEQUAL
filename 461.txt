It's important to try to give her the prescribed medicine as directed, as it can help her get better faster. Here are a few things you can try:\n\nGive the medicine with food: Try giving your daughter the medicine with a small snack or meal to see if that helps her keep it down.\n\nUse a different form of the medicine: If the medicine is available in a different form (such as a liquid or chewable tablet), you can try giving it to her in that form.\n\nGive smaller doses more frequently: Instead of giving your daughter the full dose all at once, try giving her smaller doses more frequently throughout the day. This may be easier for her to tolerate and may help her keep the medicine down.\n\nConsult with your doctor: If your daughter continues to vomit the medicine or if you are concerned about her condition, it's important to consult with your doctor. They may be able to suggest a different medication or dosage, or they may need to see your daughter in person to determine the best course of treatment.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful. It's always important to follow your doctor's recommendations and to seek medical advice if you have any concerns about your daughter's health.<>medicine
