Please explain what is \"Wearable computer\"<>A wearable computer, also known as a body-borne computer, is a computing device worn on the body. The definition of 'wearable computer' may be narrow or broad, extending to smartphones or even ordinary wristwatches.\nWearables may be for general use, in which case they are just a particularly small example of mobile computing. Alternatively, they may be for specialized purposes such as fitness trackers. They may incorporate special sensors such as accelerometers, heart rate monitors, or on the more advanced side, electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitors. Under the definition of wearable computers, we also include novel user interfaces such as Google Glass, an optical head-mounted display controlled by gestures. It may be that specialized wearables will evolve into general all-in-one devices, as happened with the convergence of PDAs and mobile phones into smartphones.\nWearables are typically worn on the wrist (e.g. fitness trackers), hung from the neck (like a necklace), strapped to the arm or leg (smartphones when exercising), or on the head (as glasses or a helmet), though some have been located elsewhere (e.g. on a finger or in a shoe). Devices carried in a pocket or bag â€“ such as smartphones and before them, pocket calculators and PDAs, may or may not be regarded as 'worn'.\nWearable computers have various technical issues common to other mobile computing, such as batteries, heat dissipation, software architectures, wireless and personal area networks, and data management. Many wearable computers are active all the time, e.g. processing or recording data continuously.<>A wearable computer, also known as a wearables, is a computer that is worn on the body, typically as a wristwatch, headset, or other type of clothing or accessory. Wearable computers are designed to be portable and convenient, allowing users to access information and perform tasks while on the go. They often include features such as touchscreens, sensors, and wireless connectivity, and may be used for a variety of purposes such as tracking fitness, receiving notifications, and controlling other devices. Wearable computers may be powered by batteries or other portable power sources, and may be designed to be worn for extended periods of time. Some examples of wearable computers include smartwatches, fitness trackers, and augmented reality glasses.<>wiki_csai
