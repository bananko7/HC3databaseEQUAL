Why on old buildings they replace \" U \" with \" V \" in carved stones ? I just walked past the American Mvsevm of Natvral History . What 's the deal ? Not like they could n't carve rounded characters . Please explain like I'm five.<>An allograph is a variation of a letter in another context . Uppercase and lowercase letters are allographs . Before the letter U was added to the Latin alphabet , the shape V was an allograph and stood for both the vowel U and the consonant V. It was nâ€™t until printing standardized letter shapes in the 1600s that the letter U became regularly used , but I could n't say why the museum used the shape V in their text . Maybe the architect was a history buff . Interesting Factoid : Many older cities do n't have a J Street because , back then , type had yet to be standardized , and I and J were also allographs . Edit : I forgot this one and my wife reminded me . Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade : Indy almost falls to his death because he forgot : \" In Latin Jehovah begins with an \" I \" \" .<>The letter \"U\" and the letter \"V\" were originally used interchangeably in the Latin alphabet and were both used to represent the same sound, which is similar to the sound of the English letter \"w\". In fact, the letter \"U\" was originally just a variant of the letter \"V\" that was used at the beginning of a word. \nOver time, the two letters developed slightly different shapes, with \"U\" becoming more rounded and \"V\" becoming more pointed. However, the distinction between the two letters was not always consistent, and it was not until the Middle Ages that the modern shapes of the letters \"U\" and \"V\" became standardized. \nIn some older texts and inscriptions, you may still see the letter \"U\" being used in place of the letter \"V\" or vice versa. This is because the distinction between the two letters was not always consistently applied in the past, and the use of the letters varied depending on the time period and the language being written. \nSo, in the case of the American Museum of Natural History, it is likely that the use of the letter \"V\" in place of the letter \"U\" is simply a reflection of the conventions that were used when the building was constructed. The carvers may have used the letter \"V\" because that is how it was traditionally written, or because it was easier to carve the pointed shape of the letter \"V\" into stone.<>reddit_eli5
