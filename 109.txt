Please explain what is \"Sentence embedding\"<>Sentence embedding is the collective name for a set of techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where sentences are mapped to vectors of real numbers.<>Sentence embedding is a method for representing a sentence in a fixed-length vector space, so that the similarity between sentences can be quantified using standard vector space operations. There are various techniques for constructing sentence embeddings, but the basic idea is to convert a sentence into a numerical representation that captures the meaning of the sentence.\n\n\n\nOne common way to create sentence embeddings is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, to pre-process the sentence, and then use a machine learning model, such as a neural network, to learn a numerical representation of the sentence based on its structure and content. The resulting vector can then be used as input to other machine learning models, such as for text classification or clustering.\n\n\n\nSentence embeddings have a number of applications, including information retrieval, natural language understanding, and machine translation. They can also be used to improve the performance of other NLP tasks, such as text summarization and question answering.<>wiki_csai
