Please explain what is \"Multi-layer perceptron\"<>A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a fully connected class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). The term MLP is used ambiguously, sometimes loosely to mean any feedforward ANN, sometimes strictly to refer to networks composed of multiple layers of perceptrons (with threshold activation); see § Terminology. Multilayer perceptrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"vanilla\" neural networks, especially when they have a single hidden layer.\nAn MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.<>A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that is composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons. It is called a multi-layer perceptron because it consists of at least three layers of neurons: an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers. The input layer receives the input data, the hidden layers process the data, and the output layer produces the output.\n\n\n\nMLPs are used for a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, and function approximation. They are particularly well-suited for tasks that require complex decision boundaries, such as recognizing handwritten digits or classifying images.\n\n\n\nMLPs are trained using a variant of the backpropagation algorithm, which involves adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons in order to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. The weights are adjusted iteratively, using a process called gradient descent, until the error is minimized.\n\n\n\nOne of the key features of MLPs is that they are fully connected, meaning that every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. This allows them to model complex relationships between the input and output data. However, this also means that MLPs can require a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.<>wiki_csai
