If I have $1000 to invest in penny stocks online, should I diversify risk and invest in many of them or should I invest in just in one?<>These stocks have no value to them, are just waiting for paper work to liquefy and vanish. The other gamblers are bots waiting for some sucker to buy so they can sell right away. So maybe a fresh new penny stock that hasn't been botted yet gives some higher chance of success, but you probably need to be a bot to sell it quickly enough. All in all not that much different from buying regular stocks...<>It's generally a good idea to diversify your investments, especially when you are investing in high-risk assets like penny stocks. By spreading your money out over a number of different stocks, you can reduce the impact of any one investment on your overall portfolio. This can help to mitigate risk and improve the stability of your portfolio.That being said, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to investing. The right approach for you will depend on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and other personal factors. It's a good idea to do your own research and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions.<>finance
