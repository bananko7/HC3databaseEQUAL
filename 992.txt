I earn $75K, have $30K in savings, no debt, rent from my parents who are losing their home. Should I buy a home now or save?<>You earn $75,000 yearly and saved $30,000 while living at home, for two years, rent-free. I am assuming you have been making good money for at least 2 years. How is it possible you only put away $30,000 on $150,000 of income? Were you giving something to your parents each week as rent, so they don't lose their home? Second, if you're not sure if you will be relocated in a year or two it makes no sense to buy. House prices won't spike like they have in the past any time soon. In one year, you can save another $30,000 without suffering since you live rent free. Many couples don't even make $75,000 and they got a mortgage, 2 kids and car payments.<>Buying a home is a significant financial decision that requires careful consideration of your personal financial situation and long-term goals. Here are a few things to consider when deciding whether to buy a home now or save:Affordability: Can you afford the upfront and ongoing costs of homeownership, including the down payment, closing costs, mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs?Financial stability: Do you have a stable income and good credit, and are you confident in your ability to make regular mortgage payments?Long-term plans: Do you plan to stay in the area for at least a few years, or do you expect to move soon? Buying a home generally requires a longer-term commitment.Savings goals: Do you have other financial goals that you would like to prioritize, such as saving for retirement or paying off debt?Overall, it's important to weigh the costs and benefits of homeownership against your personal financial situation and goals. If you're not ready to commit to a mortgage or you have other financial priorities, it may be more beneficial to continue saving and renting for now. However, if you are financially stable and ready to commit to homeownership, it may be a good time to consider buying a home.<>finance
