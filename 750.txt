Why are Gun Sounds in most action movies unrealistic \/ not the real sound of the weapon ? I was just watching Die Hard and got curious . Please explain like I'm five.<>The short answer is movie theater , and especially home theater \/ tv speakers can not mimic a gun shot , so you basically have to make it sound like something . Most movie theaters average about 85 decibels for a sound track . A 9 mm gunshot is about 150 decibels . If you were to muffle a real 150db gunshot down to 85db , it would n't even sound like a gun shot . So in Hollywood , they have to basically engineer a sound that is believable .<>In movies, sound effects are often added or enhanced in post-production to make the film more exciting or dramatic. The actual sound of a gun firing may not be loud or intense enough on its own, so the sound designers will add other elements to make the gun sounds more impactful. They might also use sounds from different types of guns or mix in other sounds like explosions or metal clanging to create the desired effect. In real life, gun sounds can vary depending on the type of gun, the type of ammunition being used, and the environment the gun is fired in. So, it's not uncommon for movie gun sounds to be different from the sounds of real guns.<>reddit_eli5
