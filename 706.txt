Gargle with warm salt water to relieve throat pain.2. Analgesics like paracetamol 3. Antibiotics (if bacterial infection is suspected)4. Antihistamine preparations can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.So...it will be better to consult an ENT specialist & start treatment as advised.Meanwhile...make sure that your son avoids cold food & drinks, maintains adequate hydration & takes soft, non-spicy foods. Wish him a good health & a speedy recovery.Let me know if I need to clarify further.Thanks & take care.<>It is possible that your son is experiencing an allergic reaction to the capsicum and paneer. Allergic reactions can vary in severity and may involve symptoms such as throat pain, coughing, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms may improve with treatment, but they may also recur if exposure to the allergen continues.\n\nIf your son is experiencing recurrent allergic reactions after eating capsicum and paneer, it is important to avoid these foods in the future to prevent further allergic reactions. You may also want to consider discussing your son's symptoms with an allergist or immunologist, who can perform allergy testing to determine which specific substances are causing the allergic reactions and help develop a plan to manage the allergies. In the meantime, it is important to follow your doctor's instructions for treating the allergic reactions and to seek medical attention if the symptoms worsen or do not improve.<>medicine
