Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. Rajesh Gayakwad<>There are many potential causes for an inability to stand and walk. Some possible causes may include muscle weakness or atrophy, neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries, or balance problems. The high CPK and NAC levels that your cousin's doctor mentioned may be indicative of muscle damage or inflammation. It is important for your cousin to follow his doctor's recommendations and receive proper treatment to address the underlying cause of his inability to stand and walk. It is not possible for me to predict whether this problem will reoccur without more information about the specific cause and treatment. It is important for your cousin to continue to receive medical care and follow-up with his doctor to manage any underlying conditions and ensure his overall health and well-being.<>medicine
