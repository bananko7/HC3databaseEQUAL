Does a glassy stare indicate brain damage?My father aspirated. Then needed a ventilator. He seemed to be heavily sedated. Nurse said it was light sedation. He didnt react to much when tube was put down his throat into his lung. A few times he opened his eyes and had a wide eyed glassy stare with no blinking. Did he have brain damage that caused these symptoms?<>Hello,Regarding your concern, I would explain that his symptoms are suggestive of severe brain damage, which could be caused by hypoxia. I recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam. A brain CT scan may be needed.Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist<>It is possible that a person who has aspirated and required mechanical ventilation may experience a range of symptoms, including a glassy stare, due to the effects of the aspiration and the sedatives and other medications used during mechanical ventilation. However, it is important to note that a glassy stare alone is not necessarily indicative of brain damage.\n\nThere are many potential causes of a glassy stare, including head injury, stroke, brain tumors, and certain medications or substances. In order to determine the cause of a glassy stare, it is important for a healthcare provider to perform a thorough evaluation and consider the person's medical history and other symptoms.\n\nIf you are concerned about your father's symptoms and whether he may have experienced brain damage, it is important to speak with his healthcare provider for further information and guidance.<>medicine
