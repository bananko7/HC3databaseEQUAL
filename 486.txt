Allergies can cause swelling in the throat and tongue, as well as congestion and headaches. It is also possible that the fluid-filled swellings you are experiencing are related to swelling of the lymph nodes, which can occur in response to infection or inflammation.\n\nIt is important to see a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your symptoms and to determine the most appropriate treatment. They may recommend allergy testing or other diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, you can try using over-the-counter allergy medication to help manage your symptoms. It is also important to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with people who are sick, to reduce your risk of infection.<>medicine
