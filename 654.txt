Please explain what is \"Instrumental convergence\"<>Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent beings (both human and non-human) to pursue similar sub-goals, even if their ultimate goals are quite different. More precisely, agents (beings with agency) may pursue instrumental goals—goals which are made in pursuit of some particular end, but are not the end goals themselves—without end, provided that their ultimate (intrinsic) goals may never be fully satisfied. Instrumental convergence posits that an intelligent agent with unbounded but apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole, unconstrained goal of solving an incredibly difficult mathematics problem like the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into one giant computer in an effort to increase its computational power so that it can succeed in its calculations.\nProposed basic AI drives include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, self-improvement, and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.<>Instrumental convergence refers to the process by which different agents or systems adopt similar strategies or behaviors in order to achieve their goals. This can occur when different agents are faced with similar constraints or incentives and adopt similar solutions in order to achieve their objectives. Instrumental convergence can lead to the emergence of common patterns of behavior or cultural norms in a group or society.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a group of farmers who are all trying to increase their crop yields. Each farmer may have different resources and techniques at their disposal, but they may all adopt similar strategies, such as using irrigation or fertilizers, in order to increase their yields. In this case, the farmers have converged on similar strategies as a result of their shared objective of increasing crop yields.\n\n\n\nInstrumental convergence can occur in many different contexts, including economic, social, and technological systems. It is often driven by the need to achieve efficiency or effectiveness in achieving a particular goal. Understanding the forces that drive instrumental convergence can be important for predicting and influencing the behavior of agents or systems.<>wiki_csai
