Make sure you lose weight, and also work with your doctor to help regularise your menstrual cycle. After this your doctor will prescribe fertility medication through which your chances of pregnancy will increase.Best wishes.<>It is possible that you may be able to become pregnant with a follicle size of 1.33*1.00 cm, but it is not a guarantee. Follicle size is just one factor that can influence your ability to become pregnant. Other factors that can affect your fertility include your overall health, the regularity of your menstrual cycles, the quality of your eggs, and the presence of any underlying medical conditions that may affect fertility.\n\nIf you are trying to become pregnant and have been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment. This may include lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine, as well as medications that can help regulate your menstrual cycle and increase your chances of ovulating. In some cases, assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be recommended.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that fertility can vary from person to person and can change over time. It is not always possible to predict with certainty whether or when an individual will become pregnant. If you are concerned about your fertility, it is a good idea to discuss your concerns with a healthcare provider who can assess your overall health and provide you with guidance and support.<>medicine
