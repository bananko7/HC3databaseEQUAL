Please explain what is \"Dynamic Bayesian network\"<>A Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is a Bayesian network (BN) which relates variables to each other over adjacent time steps. This is often called a Two-Timeslice BN (2TBN) because it says that at any point in time T, the value of a variable can be calculated from the internal regressors and the immediate prior value (time T-1).  DBNs were developed by Paul Dagum in the early 1990s at Stanford University's Section on Medical Informatics. Dagum developed DBNs to unify and extend traditional linear state-space models such as Kalman filters, linear and normal forecasting models such as ARMA and simple dependency models such as hidden Markov models into a general probabilistic representation and inference mechanism for arbitrary nonlinear and non-normal time-dependent domains.\nToday, DBNs are common in robotics, and have shown potential for a wide range of data mining applications.  For example, they have been used in speech recognition, digital forensics, protein sequencing, and bioinformatics.  DBN is a generalization of hidden Markov models and Kalman filters.\nDBNs are conceptually related to Probabilistic Boolean Networks  and can, similarly, be used to model dynamical systems at steady-state.<>A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a type of probabilistic graphical model that represents the relationship between a set of variables and their possible values over time. It is a generalization of a Bayesian network, which is a graphical model used to represent the probabilistic relationships between variables and their possible values, to handle temporal dependencies between variables.\n\n\n\nIn a DBN, each variable is represented by a node in the graph, and the edges between nodes represent the dependencies between variables. The nodes in a DBN are arranged in layers, with the variables at each layer representing the state of the system at different points in time. The edges between nodes in the same layer represent the dependencies between variables at the same time, while the edges between nodes in different layers represent the dependencies between variables at different times.\n\n\n\nDBNs are useful for modeling systems that change over time, as they allow you to represent the temporal dependencies between variables and make predictions about future states of the system. They are widely used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, bioinformatics, and finance.<>wiki_csai
