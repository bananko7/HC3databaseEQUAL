Is elevated PSA level symptom of cancer?HI I recently finished a 21 day course of cipro for an elevated psa of 4.46 which was discovered in May. The end result was an increase of my psa to over 5. I might add that I am 66 years old and less than a year ago my count was 2.9. I am to have a biopsy done in one weeks time. Does this signal that I have cancer?<>High PSA levels can also be due conditions other than prostate cancer like : prostatitis,  enlarged prostate, etc. Clinical examination and imaging studies like Ultrasound may be advised to pinpoint the cause along with biopsy. Examination of tissue under the microscope is always the definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer.<>An elevated PSA level can be a symptom of cancer, but it is not necessarily a definitive indicator. PSA stands for prostate-specific antigen, and it is a protein produced by cells in the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood.\n\nElevated PSA levels can be caused by a variety of factors, including prostate cancer, an enlarged prostate (also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia), prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), and even certain medications. It is important to keep in mind that having an elevated PSA level does not necessarily mean that you have cancer.\n\nIt is important to undergo further testing, such as a prostate biopsy, to determine the cause of an elevated PSA level. During a prostate biopsy, a small tissue sample is taken from the prostate and examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.\n\nIt is also important to discuss your concerns and any symptoms you may be experiencing with your healthcare provider. They will be able to provide you with more information and guidance on your specific situation.<>medicine
