These can help to exfoliate the skin and promote the growth of new, healthy skin cells.\n\nUse a gentle, non-abrasive facial scrub or alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) product to exfoliate the skin. This can help to remove dead skin cells and improve the overall texture and tone of your skin.\n\nConsider trying a chemical peel, which uses a solution to remove the top layers of skin, revealing newer, smoother skin underneath.\n\nUse a skin-lightening product containing ingredients such as hydroquinone or kojic acid to help fade hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone.\n\nAvoid picking at pimples or squeezing pimples, as this can worsen acne and lead to scarring.\n\nProtect your skin from the sun by wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Sun exposure can worsen hyperpigmentation and scarring.\n\nConsider seeing a dermatologist or other skin care professional for treatment options such as laser therapy, microdermabrasion, or other medical procedures. These treatments can be more effective at reducing the appearance of scars and acne marks, but they may be more expensive and may require multiple treatments.\n\nIt's important to note that it can take time for scars and acne marks to fade, and results may vary depending on the individual. It's also important to be patient and consistent with your skin care routine, as it can take several weeks or even months to see improvement.<>medicine
