Please explain what is \"Human Compatible\"<>Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control is a 2019 non-fiction book by computer scientist Stuart J. Russell. It asserts that risk to humanity from advanced artificial intelligence (AI) is a serious concern despite the uncertainty surrounding future progress in AI. It also proposes an approach to the AI control problem.<>\"Human compatible\" refers to the idea that a system or technology should be designed to work well with human beings, rather than against them or in spite of them. It implies that the system takes into account the needs, limitations, and preferences of humans, and that it is designed to be easy for humans to use, understand, and interact with.\n\n\n\nThe concept of human compatibility is often applied to the design of computer systems, software, and other technological tools, as well as to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning systems. In these contexts, the goal is to create systems that are intuitive, user-friendly, and that can adapt to the way humans think, learn, and communicate.\n\n\n\nHuman compatibility is also a key consideration in the field of ethics, particularly when it comes to the use of AI and other technologies that have the potential to impact society and individual lives. Ensuring that these technologies are human compatible can help to minimize negative impacts and ensure that they are used in a way that is beneficial to humanity as a whole.<>wiki_csai
