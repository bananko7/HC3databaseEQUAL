How do animals hibernate for so long ? How do some animals manage to hibernate for so long without needing to poop or eat . Also , do they wake up in the middle of their hibernation sessions or not ? Explain like I'm five.<>I can answer the poop part of your question . Bears eat tons of grass prior to hibernation to form a butt plug . This keeps them from defecating . I 'm sure other animals have a similar mechanism .<>Hibernation is a way that some animals, like bears and groundhogs, sleep through the winter when there is not much food available. When an animal hibernates, its body slows down and it doesn't need to eat or drink as much. Its heart rate and breathing also slow down, so the animal doesn't use up as much energy. During hibernation, the animal's body temperature also drops. This helps it to conserve energy because it doesn't have to use as much energy to keep warm. Some animals, like bears, do wake up during their hibernation period, but they usually don't move around much. They might stretch or get a drink of water, but then they go back to sleep. Other animals, like groundhogs, might not wake up at all during their hibernation period. So, to answer your question, animals that hibernate are able to sleep for a long time without needing to eat or poop because their bodies are able to conserve energy and they don't need as much food or water. They might wake up during their hibernation period, but they usually don't do much except go back to sleep.<>reddit_eli5
