However, if you have concerns about your child's language development, it is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional.\n\nAt this age, it is common for children to be able to say a few words, such as \"mummy\" and \"papa,\" and to understand and follow simple instructions. They may also be able to combine words to express simple ideas, such as \"more juice\" or \"doggy gone.\"\n\nIf your child is attending a school that has raised concerns about their language development, it may be helpful to speak with the teacher about their observations and to discuss any concerns you may have. It is also a good idea to speak with your child's healthcare provider, who can assess your child's overall development and provide guidance on any next steps that may be necessary.<>medicine
