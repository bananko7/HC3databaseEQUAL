Please explain what is \"Jürgen Schmidhuber\"<>Jürgen Schmidhuber (born 17 January 1963) is a German computer scientist most noted for his work in the field of artificial intelligence, deep learning and artificial neural networks. He is a co-director of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research in Lugano, in Ticino in southern Switzerland. Following Google Scholar, from 2016 to 2021 he has received more than 100,000 scientific citations. He has been referred to as \"father of modern AI,\"[10]  \"father of AI,\"[11][12][13] \"dad of mature AI,\"  \"Papa\" of famous AI products,[14] \"Godfather,\"[15] and \"father of deep learning.\"[16] (Schmidhuber himself, however, has called Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko the \"father of deep learning.\"[17])\nSchmidhuber completed his undergraduate (1987) and PhD (1991) studies at the Technical University of Munich in Munich, Germany. His PhD advisors were Wilfried Brauer and Klaus Schulten.[18] He taught there from 2004 until 2009 when he became a professor of artificial intelligence at the Università della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland.[19]<>Jürgen Schmidhuber is a German computer scientist and artificial intelligence (AI) researcher who has made significant contributions to the field of machine learning, particularly in the areas of deep learning and artificial neural networks. He is also known for his work on reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation.\n\n\n\nSchmidhuber received his PhD in computer science from the Technical University of Munich in 1990, and has held academic positions at several universities in Europe and the United States. He is currently a professor at the University of Lugano in Switzerland and a researcher at the Swiss AI laboratory IDSIA.\n\n\n\nSchmidhuber is the co-founder and chief scientist of the company Nnaisense, which is focused on developing artificial intelligence solutions for a wide range of applications. He has also received numerous awards and accolades for his work, including the European Association for Artificial Intelligence's (EurAI) Distinguished Service Award and the Neural Networks Pioneer Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).<>wiki_csai
