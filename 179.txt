Please explain what is \"Human computation\"<>Human-based computation (HBC), human-assisted computation, ubiquitous human computing or distributed thinking (by analogy to distributed computing) is a computer science technique in which a machine performs its function by outsourcing certain steps to humans, usually as microwork. This approach uses differences in abilities and alternative costs between humans and computer agents to achieve symbiotic humanâ€“computer interaction. For computationally difficult tasks such as image recognition, human-based computation plays a central role in training Deep Learning-based Artificial Intelligence systems. In this case, human-based computation has been referred to as human-aided artificial intelligence.\nIn traditional computation, a human employs a computer to solve a problem; a human provides a formalized problem description and an algorithm to a computer, and receives a solution to interpret. Human-based computation frequently reverses the roles; the computer asks a person or a large group of people to solve a problem, then collects, interprets, and integrates their solutions. This turns hybrid networks of humans and computers into \"large scale distributed computing networks\". where code is partially executed in human brains and on silicon based processors.<>Human computation is a field of study that focuses on the design of systems that combine the strengths of humans and computers to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for either to solve individually. These systems often rely on the collective intelligence and diverse skills of large numbers of people, who work together to solve problems or perform tasks that are too complex or time-consuming for a single person or a computer to complete.\n\n\n\nExamples of human computation include crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, which allow companies to outsource small tasks or jobs to a large, distributed workforce. Other examples include online games or other interactive systems that rely on human players to solve problems or perform tasks, such as finding solutions to puzzles, identifying objects in images, or transcribing speech or text.\n\n\n\nHuman computation can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including tasks related to data analysis, natural language processing, image or video recognition, and other areas where human judgment or intuition is valuable. It can also be used to facilitate collaboration and communication among large groups of people, or to harness the collective knowledge and expertise of a community to solve problems or make decisions.<>wiki_csai
