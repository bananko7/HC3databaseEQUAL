How did US area code boundaries get decided ? I know that some area codes are for entire states , while others only cover a single city . Who decided these and how ? Explain like I'm five. <>Population sorta originally . A group called NANPA(North American Numbering Plan Area Code ) decides it and in more recent years it has a lot more to do with emergency service coverage than population though they are obviously linked to each other . At some point you run out of 7 digit numbers and have to start a new area code . They try to keep them altogether but given how frequently people move and how often people on mobile refuse to give up old numbers it has all kinda fallen apart .<>Area codes in the United States were first introduced in the 1940s to help with the growing need for telephone lines. At that time, phone numbers were only seven digits long, and each area code was assigned to a specific region of the country.\\n\\nOver time, as more people got phones and the demand for phone lines grew, it became necessary to add more area codes. This happened for a few reasons. One reason is that some areas of the country, such as big cities, needed more phone lines than other areas. Another reason is that some area codes were running out of available phone numbers.\\n\\nThe process of deciding which area codes to use and where to place them is called \"numbering plan administration.\" This is done by a group of people called the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA). NANPA is responsible for making sure that every phone number in the United States is unique and that there are enough phone numbers to go around.\\n\\nTo decide which area codes to use, NANPA considers a few things, such as how many phone lines are needed in a particular area and how many phone numbers are available in a particular area code. NANPA also tries to make sure that area codes are assigned in a way that makes it easy for people to remember their phone numbers and for phone companies to route calls to the correct locations.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>reddit_eli5
