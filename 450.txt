Why is Internet Explorer a bad web Browser I am aware of its reputation both through satire and first hand experience but I still do n't know exactly what makes this browser so bad Explain like I'm five.<>In 1994 , Bill Gates got hip to the internet . MS purchased rights to some code named [ Mosaic from NCSA ] ( URL_0 ) . For about the next ten years , MS did everything they could to make internet technology proprietary and owned by them . Because they continued to create their software in a manner indifferent to open source standards , their browser did n't work very well . Lately , it is much improved but reputation are hard to overcome .<>Internet Explorer is a web browser that was very popular in the past, but it is not as good as some newer web browsers because it is slower, less secure, and not as compatible with modern websites. This means that it can take longer to load websites, it is more vulnerable to being hacked, and it might not be able to show all the features of a website correctly. Because of these problems, many people prefer to use other web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari, instead of Internet Explorer.<>reddit_eli5
