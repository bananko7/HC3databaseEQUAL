Why is x\/0 undefined while 0\/0 is undetermined ? What 's the difference between the two anyway ? Are n't both inapplicable ? Explain like I'm five.<>The first thing to note is that we can never divide by 0 . So both of these expressions are undefined , technically . However , in the context of limits ( I 'll explain in a second ) when things look like they 're going to x\/0 or 0\/0 we do different things . To start , a limit is simply explained as what does a function look like its doing as we get close to a point . We typically introduce limits by picking points closer and closer to a value and see where these results looks like they 're going . So , we want to know what 's going on around x = 1 of the function ( x^2 - 1)\/(x-1 ) . We try to plug in x = 1 but we quickly realize that we see 0\/0 . So we pick the point 0.9 and plug it in then 0.99 and 0.999 and numbers closer and closer to 1 . Then we point 1.1 and 1.01 and 1.001 and number closer and closer to 1 from the other direction and get this table x f(x ) 0.9 1.9 0.99 1.99 0.999 1.999 1 0\/0 ? ? ? 1.001 2.001 1.01 2.01 1.1 2.1 and we can easily see that in this case 0\/0 meant 2 . In another case : ( x^2 + x - 6)\/(x^2 - x -2 ) as we get close to 2 . Well , plugging in x = 2 gives us 0\/0 again . But a table analysis like above will tell use that this is really 1.666 Yet another case : ( e^x -x -1)\/x^2 as x gets close to 0 . Plugging in 0 tells us 0\/0 . But a table analysis ( taking a limit ) tells us 0.5 So 0\/0 can really mean anything ! ---- Alternatively , let 's look at things that end up as x\/0 . First example is ( x^2 ) \/(x-2 ) as we get closer to 2 . We try to plug in 2 and we get 4\/0 . Let 's do a table : x f(x ) 1.9 -36.1 1.99 -396.01 1.999 -3996 Things are going way off to negative infinity ! Let 's try the other direction : x f(x ) 2.1 44.1 2.01 404.01 2.001 4004 Things are going way off to the positive infinity ! Okay ... maybe it was a fluke . Let 's try another limit of the form x\/0 : say ... 2\/(e^x -1 ) as we get close to x=0 . Plugging in x = 0 tells us 2\/0 . Right form . But building a table gives us infinities again ! So , we can see from a few examples here that x\/0 means infinities , while 0\/0 can mean anything . So , we call one of them undefined ( or really infinite ) and the other we call indeterminate because it can be anything , we just do n't know what . ( There are advanced ways of determining the \" what \" without building a table , but this should convey the point . ) ---- But really , what does all this mean ? Why do we care about limits ? Well , limits are the foundation for modern calculus . They can explain how rockets fly , how fireworks explode , nuclear reactors , electrical circuits , and many many more things . ---- TL;DR : This deals with the calculus topics of limits . Which is the question \" what happens when we get close to _ _ _ _ _ \" . And if it looks like x\/0 then we get an infinity ( undefined ) and if looks like 0\/0 we can get anything ( undetermined ) .<>Sure! When we divide a number by another number, we are asking \"how many times does the second number go into the first number?\" For example, if we divide 10 by 2, we are asking \"how many times does 2 go into 10?\" The answer is 5, because 2 goes into 10 five times.\r\n\r\nNow, let's think about what happens when we try to divide a number by zero. Dividing a number by zero is like asking \"how many times does zero go into this number?\" Zero does not go into any number at all, so we say that dividing a number by zero is undefined.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we try to divide zero by zero, we are asking \"how many times does zero go into zero?\" Zero goes into zero zero times, so we say that the answer is undetermined. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
