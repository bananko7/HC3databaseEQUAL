How do polaroid pictures work ? How do the pictures just slowly come in there etc ? Explain like I'm five. <>Freakin ' magic , that 's how ! In a nutshell , a polaroid is a little envelope that contains all the chemicals needed to develop and fix the picture . Light hits chemicals that are sensitive to light , which react with reagents in a different layer that cause dyes to migrate into the first layer and become visible . Developing a photograph takes time ( the chemical reactions are n't instantaneous ) , and the first process to do instant color prints did n't work very well . The solution was to add another layer of chemicals that opacify soon after the exposure to light . This makes it dark inside the layers , and allows the time necessary for the developing and fixing process to happen without being exposed to more light . That opacifier breaks down and becomes clear after a period of time . That 's what you 're actually seeing when the polaroid comes out grey and image slowly shows up .<>Polaroid pictures are a type of instant film photography. They use a special type of film that contains all the chemicals needed to develop the photograph right inside the film itself.\\n\\nTo take a polaroid picture, you first need a camera that is designed to use polaroid film. You load the film into the camera, just like you would with any other type of film.\\n\\nThen, when you take a picture, the camera uses a flash to expose the film to light. This causes a chemical reaction inside the film, which starts to develop the photograph.\\n\\nAs the chemical reaction continues, the picture slowly starts to appear on the film. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the type of film you are using.\\n\\nOnce the picture is fully developed, you can gently peel it off the film and hold it in your hand. It's a magical moment, especially for kids!<>reddit_eli5
