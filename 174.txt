Please explain what is \"Expert systems\"<>In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert.\nExpert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as ifâ€“then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software. \nAn expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.<>Expert systems are computer programs designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a specific domain. Expert systems use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as natural language processing, machine learning, and reasoning, to provide solutions to problems and make decisions based on incomplete or uncertain information.\n\n\n\nExpert systems are used to solve complex problems that would otherwise require a high level of expertise or specialized knowledge. They can be used in a wide range of fields, including medicine, finance, engineering, and law, to assist with diagnosis, analysis, and decision-making.\n\n\n\nExpert systems typically have a knowledge base that contains information about a specific domain, and a set of rules or algorithms that are used to process and analyze the information in the knowledge base. The knowledge base is usually created by a human expert in the domain and is used to guide the expert system in its decision-making process.\n\n\n\nExpert systems can be used to provide recommendations or make decisions on their own, or they can be used to support and assist human experts in their decision-making process. They are often used to provide rapid and accurate solutions to problems that would be time-consuming or difficult for a human to solve on their own.<>wiki_csai
