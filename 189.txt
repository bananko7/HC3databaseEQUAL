Please explain what is \"Internet of things\"<>The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks. Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet, they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.\nThe field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, as well as machine learning.  Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.[10]  In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the \"smart home\", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.[11]\nThere are a number of concerns about the risks in the growth of IoT technologies and products, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently, industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun, including the development of international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.[12]<>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the connectivity of devices, objects, and people to the internet. It involves the integration of physical objects with internet connectivity and other technologies, such as sensors, to enable them to collect and exchange data.\n\n\n\nIn practical terms, the Internet of Things refers to a wide range of devices, including everyday objects such as thermostats, appliances, and vehicles, that are connected to the internet and can send and receive data. This data can be used to improve the efficiency and functionality of these devices, as well as to gain insights and make better decisions.\n\n\n\nFor example, a smart thermostat can use sensors to gather data on the temperature and humidity in a home and use that information to adjust the heating and cooling settings automatically. Similarly, a smart appliance such as a refrigerator can use sensors to track the expiration dates of food items and send notifications to the user when it's time to restock.\n\n\n\nThe Internet of Things has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from energy management and transportation to healthcare and agriculture. It allows for greater automation and efficiency, as well as the ability to gather and analyze data on a much larger scale.<>wiki_csai
