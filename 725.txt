What actually happens when a random command is issued to a computer ? How does the computer compute something random ? e.g. songs on shuffle , random integer generators etc . Please explain like I'm five.<>Strictly speaking , it does n't most of the time . There are algorithms that produce ( through some fairly hard to ELI5 means ) numbers that \" seem \" random , usually by feeding something like the number of milliseconds since your computer booted up into a function built to scramble things up . Truly random numbers , which are rarely needed , are generated by taking advantage of the random thermal movements of molecules in a processor or the like .<>When you give a computer a command to do something random, it uses a special program called a \"random number generator\" to come up with a random answer. A random number generator is like a machine that can spit out any number at all, and it's really hard to predict what number it will spit out next. \nFor example, if you tell a computer to play a song on shuffle, it might use a random number generator to decide which song to play first. It might choose a number between 1 and 100, and then it will look at a list of 100 songs and play the one that corresponds to the number it chose. \nSimilarly, if you ask a computer to generate a random integer (a whole number like 1, 2, 3, etc.), it will use a random number generator to come up with a number. You can specify a range of numbers that you want the computer to choose from, like \"pick a random number between 1 and 10,\" and the computer will use its random number generator to choose a number within that range. \nI hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about how computers work?<>reddit_eli5
