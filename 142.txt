Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market   Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings   from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the   fund.<>It is difficult to define a precise percentage of the global economy that is considered \"emerging\" as this term can be applied to countries at different stages of economic development and has no specific threshold for determining whether a country is classified as \"emerging\" or not. However, it is generally accepted that emerging economies are those that are experiencing rapid economic growth and are in the process of transitioning from being low- or middle-income countries to being high-income countries. Some of the largest emerging economies in the world include China, India, Brazil, and Russia. These countries account for a significant portion of global GDP and are often considered to be key drivers of global economic growth.<>finance
