Please explain what is \"Statistical machine translation\"<>Statistical machine translation (SMT) is a machine translation paradigm where translations are generated on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora.  The statistical approach contrasts with the rule-based approaches to machine translation as well as with example-based machine translation, and has more recently been superseded by neural machine translation in many applications (see this article's final section).\nThe first ideas of statistical machine translation were introduced by Warren Weaver in 1949, including the ideas of applying Claude Shannon's information theory. Statistical machine translation was re-introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by researchers at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center and has contributed to the significant resurgence in interest in machine translation in recent years. Before the introduction of neural machine translation, it was by far the most widely studied machine translation method.<>Statistical machine translation is a type of machine translation that is based on statistical models. It involves using a large corpus of translated text to build a statistical model that can predict the most likely translation of a given source language text into a target language.\n\n\n\nThe statistical model is typically built by training the machine translation system on a large dataset of parallel text, which is a collection of texts in the source language and their corresponding translations in the target language. The system uses this dataset to learn the statistical relationships between words and phrases in the source and target languages.\n\n\n\nOnce the statistical model has been trained, it can be used to translate new texts by analyzing the probability of different translations for each word or phrase in the source text, and choosing the most likely translation based on the statistical model.\n\n\n\nStatistical machine translation has become one of the most widely used approaches to machine translation, and it has led to significant improvements in the quality and speed of machine translation over the past few decades. It is used in a variety of applications, including translation of websites, documents, and social media content.<>wiki_csai
