Math Proofs I 'm watching \" The Man Who Knew Infinity \" in which they talk a lot about math proofs . I need someone to give me a very simplistic example of what a math proof is . Explain like I'm five. <>A \" proof \" in mathematics is a logical argument that uses known - to - be - true steps to * prove * that a given conclusion is true . For example : Statement : The number 4 is an even integer . Proof : * An \" even integer \" is defined as an integer which can be written in the form of 2(k ) , where k is some integer . * The number 4 can be written in the form of 2(2 ) . * Thus , the number 4 is by definition an even integer . Or : Statement : The number 3 is an odd integer . Proof : * An odd integer is by definition an integer that can be written in the form of 2(k ) + 1 , where k is some integer . * The number 3 can be written in the form 2(1 ) + 1 * The number 3 is therefore an odd integer . Or , as a more complex example : Statement : The sum of two odd integers is always an even integer . * Let M and N be any odd integers . * By definition , M and N can be written in the form of 2(k ) + 1 and 2(j ) + 1 respectively . * By substitution , M+N = 2(k)+1 + 2(j ) + 1 * By algebra , M+N = 2(k)+2(j)+2 = 2(k+j)+2 = 2(k+j+1 ) . * Let h be some integer equal to ( k+j+1 ) . * By substitution , M+N = 2(h ) , which is of the form of an even integer . * M+N is therefore an even integer . Thus , the sum of two odd integers is always an even integer .<>Sure! A math proof is a way of showing that something is true using logical steps and evidence. Here's an example of a math proof:\\n\\nSuppose we want to prove that the sum of any two odd numbers is always even. Here's how we could do it:\\n\\nStep 1: Let's start by defining what we mean by \"odd\" and \"even\" numbers. An odd number is a number that cannot be divided evenly by 2, like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. An even number is a number that can be divided evenly by 2, like 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.\\n\\nStep 2: Now, let's choose two odd numbers and call them \"a\" and \"b\". We can represent this as \"a + b = ?\", where the question mark stands for the answer we're trying to find.\\n\\nStep 3: Since \"a\" and \"b\" are both odd numbers, we know that they both cannot be divided evenly by 2. This means that when we add them together, the result will also not be divisible by 2.\\n\\nStep 4: In math, we use the term \"even\" to describe numbers that are divisible by 2, and \"odd\" to describe numbers that are not divisible by 2. Since the result of adding \"a\" and \"b\" is not divisible by 2, we can say that it is an \"odd\" number.\\n\\nStep 5: However, we also know that the sum of any two odd numbers is always even. This means that our original assumption (that the sum of any two odd numbers is always even) must be true.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up, a math proof is a way of showing that something is true by starting with a set of assumptions and using logical steps to arrive at a conclusion.<>reddit_eli5
