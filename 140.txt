How a computer randomly generates something How does a computer randomly generate something , ie Reddit 's RANDOM link up top . How does the site select the \" random \" link ? Explain like I'm five.<>Computers have no imagination , they just do maths . This means they ca n't make up random numbers but they can take existing numbers and come up with new ones . When you generate a bunch of numbers from an existing one , that one is called a ' seed ' . The same seed will usually always result in the same bunch of new numbers . This means the trick is coming up with unexpected seeds . One way to do that is to check the system time ( the little clock in your computer ) but that 's pretty predictable too . A better way to do that is to tell the computer to come up with seeds based on how the user is interacting with the computer . This is a good way because the computer ca n't predict when you 're going to hit a key or click the mouse and it 's practically impossible for other people to duplicate your timing .<>To generate a random link, the computer uses a process called \"random number generation.\" This is a way for the computer to produce a number that is completely unpredictable and not influenced by any previous events.\n\nTo generate a random number, the computer uses a special program called a \"random number generator.\" This program uses complex mathematical algorithms to produce a series of numbers that are statistically unique and not related to one another in any predictable way.\n\nTo select a random link, the computer might use the random number generator to choose a number between 1 and the total number of links available. The computer would then select the link that corresponds to the chosen number. For example, if there are 100 links available and the random number generator selects the number 37, the computer would choose the 37th link as the \"random\" link.\n\nI hope this helps to explain how a computer can generate randomness!<>reddit_eli5
