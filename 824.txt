Please explain what is \"Multivariate polynomial\"<>In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of indeterminates (also called variables) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and positive-integer powers of variables. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate x is x2 − 4x + 7. An example with three indeterminates is x3 + 2xyz2 − yz + 1.\nPolynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, they are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary word problems to complicated scientific problems; they are used to define polynomial functions, which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science; they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions. In advanced mathematics, polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings and algebraic varieties, which are central concepts in algebra and algebraic geometry.<>In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and sometimes division (though this is not always allowed). For example, the polynomial 3x^2 + 2x - 5 is a polynomial in the variable x. The highest power of the variable in a polynomial is called the degree of the polynomial. In this case, the degree of the polynomial is 2 because the highest power of x is 2.\n\n\n\nA multivariate polynomial is a polynomial with more than one variable. For example, the expression 2x^2 + y^3 - 3z + 4 is a multivariate polynomial in the variables x, y, and z. The degree of a multivariate polynomial is the highest power of the variables in the polynomial. In this case, the degree of the polynomial is 3 because the highest power of any of the variables is 3 (in the term y^3).\n\n\n\nMultivariate polynomials can be useful for modeling relationships between multiple variables. For example, a polynomial with two variables, such as 3x^2 + 2xy + y^2, could be used to model the relationship between two variables, such as the price and demand for a product.<>wiki_csai
