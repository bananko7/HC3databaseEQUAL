Difference between personality traits and psychological disorders Things like ADD , autism , etc . Explain like I'm five. <>Something is considered a psychological disorder when it has a significant negative impact on the person 's life . Feeling sad sometimes is normal , feeling so sad and empty that you ca n't get out of bed for days is a psychological disorder . This is why we need specially trained people to determine whether someone has a psychological disorder or not on an individual basis . * * EDIT :* * I apologise if this is being taken the wrong way . I do n't at all mean to say \" you 're different to me , therefore you 're mentally ill \" . I thought being * unable * to get out of bed for days was pretty obviously pathological and not a personality trait .<>Personality traits are characteristics that make up a person's personality. They are relatively enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make each person unique. Examples of personality traits include being outgoing, shy, organized, or adventurous.\\n\\nPsychological disorders, on the other hand, are abnormal patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that cause distress or problems functioning in daily life. Examples of psychological disorders include anxiety disorders, mood disorders (such as depression or bipolar disorder), and personality disorders (such as borderline personality disorder).\\n\\nOne way to think about the difference between personality traits and psychological disorders is to consider that personality traits are a normal part of being human, while psychological disorders are abnormal and cause problems in a person's life. For example, being shy is a normal personality trait, but having an anxiety disorder can cause a person to experience extreme fear and anxiety that interferes with their ability to function in daily life.<>reddit_eli5
