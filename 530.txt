Why exactly is Benghazi such a big deal ? I understand what happened to the embassy over there and the folks in it and that sucks , what is with all the constant finger pointing ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The Republicans had a huge incentive to blow it out of proportion because , if it were true that facts were manipulated , it would not only make Obama look bad , but it would also hurt the likely Democratic presidential nominee for 2016 , Hillary Clinton . Unfortunately for the Republicans , [ many investigations ] ( URL_0 ) have shown that nearly all of their allegations they have been throwing around have been more - or - less false . The only thing they 've really got right is that the embassy was n't properly prepared to deal with an attack .<>The attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The attacks and the response of the U.S. government to them have been the subject of controversy and investigation, including several investigations by Congressional committees. Some people believe that the attacks could have been prevented or that the response to the attacks was inadequate, and that officials in the U.S. government, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, should be held accountable for any mistakes or failures. Others disagree and believe that the attacks were simply a tragic event that could not have been prevented. The controversy and investigations surrounding Benghazi have become a political issue, with some people using the attacks to criticize and attack the Obama administration and Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time of the attacks.<>reddit_eli5
