Why Does America Have Better Netflix Than Canada Why does america have better netfix if netflix already bought or licensed or whatever they had to do to be able to show the movie why ca nt they put it on canadian netflix ? is it a demographic thing ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I believe it has to do the the [ CRTC ] ( URL_0 ) and how they regulate what is broadcast in Canada . I do n't really know what 's going on , it seems to be a very convoluted situation . Google CRTC+Netflix for lots of related articles .<>There are a few reasons why the selection of movies and TV shows on Netflix may vary between countries. One reason is that Netflix has to secure the rights to stream each movie or TV show in each country where it is available. This can be a complex process, and sometimes Netflix is only able to secure the rights to stream a particular movie or TV show in certain countries. Another reason may be that Netflix is targeting different demographics in different countries, and so the company may choose to license different content in different places. For example, Netflix may license a particular movie or TV show for streaming in the United States because it believes that it will be popular with American audiences, but not license it for streaming in Canada because it believes it will not be as popular with Canadian audiences. Finally, there may be other factors at play, such as the cost of licensing content, the availability of content from different studios and production companies, and the preferences of Netflix's own content curators. All of these factors can contribute to the differences in the selection of movies and TV shows on Netflix between different countries.<>reddit_eli5
