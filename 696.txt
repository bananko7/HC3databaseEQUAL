Suggest remedy for lump on templeMy 7 year old grandson has a lump on his temple he says he may have had since last night but I didn t notice until today. It has a center red dot like a bite mark, but is much more like a hard lump than a mosquito bite would be. He says he didn t fall and hit it. He also says it s not itchy and I wondered if it could be a tick or even a spider bite. Should we be concerned?<>Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The lump on the temporal region can be because of the insect bite. Nothing to be panic, it is a self limiting condition. If you have pain then take an analgesic like ibuprofen(if you are not allergic). Since you do not have any itching, no need to worry or any treatment. If the swelling is not reducing in 3-5days, then consult a pediatrician and get it evaluated.I hope I have answered your query, take care.<>It is important to get the lump on your grandson's temple checked out by a healthcare provider. It is possible that it could be a mosquito bite, a tick bite, or a spider bite, but it could also be something else. It is always better to have a healthcare provider assess any lumps or bumps on the body to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to keep the area clean and dry, and you can apply a cool compress to the area to help reduce swelling and discomfort. If your grandson experiences any other symptoms, such as fever, dizziness, or difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention right away.<>medicine
