A \" rolled \" ankle is a sprained ankle<>A rolled ankle, also known as an ankle sprain, happens when you accidentally twist or turn your ankle in an awkward way, causing the ligaments (tissues that connect bones) to stretch or tear. This can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty moving your ankle.\r\n\r\nA sprained ankle is also caused by twisting or turning your ankle in an awkward way, but it is a more severe injury than a rolled ankle. In a sprained ankle, the ligaments are stretched or torn more severely, and it can take longer to heal.\r\n\r\nThe reason you can often \"walk off\" a rolled ankle is because the ligaments are not as severely damaged, so you may be able to put weight on your foot and walk without too much pain. However, with a sprained ankle, the ligaments are damaged more severely, so it may be too painful to put weight on your foot and walk. This is why a sprained ankle may require you to take a couple of weeks off from activities like basketball.<>reddit_eli5
