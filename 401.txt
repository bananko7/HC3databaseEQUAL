This will reduce any tongue inflammation and soreness.Use a topical Gumtone gel which will reduce pain in the area.This must take care in a few days. check with your physician if it persists.Regards.<>Mouth sores and ulcers can be uncomfortable and painful. It's important to identify the cause of the sores in order to determine the most appropriate treatment.\n\nIf you have recently started taking amoxicillin, it is possible that the sores and ulcers are a side effect of the medication. In this case, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider about the best course of treatment. They may recommend that you stop taking the medication or switch to a different antibiotic.\n\nIf the sores and ulcers are not caused by the medication, there are several things you can do to alleviate discomfort and promote healing:\n\nRinse your mouth with a saltwater solution. Mix 1\/2 teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of warm water and rinse your mouth with it several times a day. This can help to reduce pain and inflammation.\n\nAvoid spicy, acidic, or rough foods that can irritate the sores.\n\nUse a soft-bristled toothbrush and avoid brushing or flossing near the sores.\n\nApply a topical cream or ointment to the sores. Over-the-counter products such as topical anesthetics or corticosteroid creams may help to reduce pain and inflammation.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids to help keep your mouth hydrated.\n\nIf the sores and ulcers do not improve within a week or if you have a fever, difficulty swallowing, or difficulty breathing, it is important to see a healthcare provider as these could be signs of a more serious condition.<>medicine
