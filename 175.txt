What happens when I ( male ) ejaculate ? Where does the pressure come from ? When do the \" pipes \" switch over and how ? Explain like I'm five.<>As to your question about the pipes , there is n't really a switchover ; what happens is that a sphincter at the base of your bladder tightens up and no urine gets out . This is why it 's so damned hard to pee at 5 AM with morning wood . As to the squirting force , my understanding is that it 's from your pelvic floor muscles , the same muscles you use to cut off the flow if you have to stop peeing for some reason . Like your diaphragm ( for breathing ) these muscles are under both voluntary and involuntary control .<>Ejaculation is the process of releasing semen, which is a fluid that contains sperm and other substances, from the penis. It usually occurs during sexual arousal and can be accompanied by pleasure and orgasm.\r\n\r\nWhen a man becomes sexually aroused, his brain sends signals to the muscles in his reproductive system to prepare for ejaculation. One of these muscles is the smooth muscle in the walls of the seminal vesicles and prostate gland, which produce the fluid that makes up most of the semen. This fluid is mixed with sperm produced by the testicles to create the semen.\r\n\r\nAs the man becomes more aroused, the muscles in the prostate and seminal vesicles contract and push the semen into the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body through the penis. At the same time, the muscles at the base of the penis contract, helping to move the semen out of the body.\r\n\r\nThe pressure that is felt during ejaculation comes from the muscles contracting and the semen being expelled from the body. The \"pipes\" that you are referring to are the tubes in the reproductive system that carry the semen from the prostate and seminal vesicles to the urethra. When a man ejaculates, the muscles in these tubes contract to push the semen through them and out of the body.<>reddit_eli5
