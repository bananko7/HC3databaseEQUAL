Explain like I'm five.<>It 's a form of self image enhancement--- makes them more attractive .<>Grinders are people who implant magnets in their bodies for various reasons. Some people do it for the sensation it provides, while others do it for the perceived benefits it has on their health or well-being.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of having a magnet implanted in your body is likely to vary from person to person, depending on where the magnet is placed and how sensitive the person's skin is. Some people report feeling a tingling or buzzing sensation when they are near electronic devices or when they move the magnet around under their skin. Others may not feel much of a sensation at all.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear exactly why magnets might have an effect on the body, or why some people believe they have health or well-being benefits. There is little scientific evidence to support these claims, and it's possible that the perceived benefits are due to the placebo effect, where a person's belief in a treatment can have a positive effect on their health.\r\n\r\nOverall, implanting magnets in the body is a risky and potentially dangerous practice. It can lead to infection, scarring, and other complications. It is not recommended by medical professionals. If you are interested in the topic, it is best to do further research and speak with a medical professional before making any decisions about your own health.<>reddit_eli5
