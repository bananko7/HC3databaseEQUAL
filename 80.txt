Is The Pirate Bay really now hosted in North Korea ? And if it 's fake , how is that done ? NT Explain like I'm five.<>Its a hoax . It was meant to point to the absurdity of Western Governments who simultaneously criticize nations like North Korea for the repression of speech while also try to shut down sites like TPB . ( A bit of an oversimplification but that 's what TPB said was their point anyway ) . TPB main hosting server was last moved to Norway . But in reality all their torrents are now mirrored , so the website is now everywhere . A move designed to preempt any government shutting them down . Think of that last scene in Terminator 3 when they thought killing one computer would stop skynet , only to realize skynet was ALL the computers . Edit : Uh - Oh'ed a word or two .<>The Pirate Bay is a website that was created to allow users to share and download files, including music, movies, and other types of digital content.
