Please explain what is \"Random optimization\"<>Random optimization (RO) is a family of numerical optimization methods that do not require the gradient of the problem to be optimized and RO can hence be used on functions that are not continuous or differentiable. Such optimization methods are also known as direct-search, derivative-free, or black-box methods.\nThe name random optimization is attributed to Matyas  who made an early presentation of RO along with basic mathematical analysis. RO works by iteratively moving to better positions in the search-space which are sampled using e.g. a normal distribution surrounding the current position.<>Random optimization is a method for finding the optimal solution to a problem by using random search. It is a type of heuristic optimization algorithm that does not rely on any prior knowledge about the problem or use any specific search strategy. Instead, it relies on random sampling to explore the space of possible solutions, with the hope that the optimal solution will be found by chance.\n\n\n\nIn random optimization, a set of potential solutions to a problem is generated randomly, and the quality of each solution is evaluated using a predefined objective function. The process is repeated a number of times, and the best solution found is retained as the result.\n\n\n\nRandom optimization can be useful when the search space is large and it is not possible to use more sophisticated optimization algorithms, or when the problem is too complex to allow for the development of a specific search strategy. However, it is generally less efficient than other optimization methods, as it relies on random chance rather than a systematic search.<>wiki_csai
