Why is it that when a YouTube video features on Reddit , their comments are flooded with ' le Reddit Army is here ' followed by attempts at insulting the video creator ? I have just joined reddit to ask this question . Please explain like I'm five.<>Because children also have access to the internet .<>The phrase \"le Reddit Army\" is often used as a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that a large number of people from Reddit have arrived to comment on a particular post or video. It's not necessarily meant to be taken seriously, and is often used in a lighthearted or humorous way. As for the insults, it's unfortunately not uncommon for people on the internet to be rude or mean-spirited towards others, especially when they are posting anonymously. This behavior is not acceptable, and it's important to remember to treat others with kindness and respect, even when you are interacting with them online.<>reddit_eli5
