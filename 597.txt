bid & ask prices and technical indicators<>If you are looking to go long (buy) you would use bid prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade to go through. If you are looking to go short (sell) you would use the ask prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade go through. In your analysis you could use either this convention or the midpoint of the two prices. As FX is very liquid the bid and ask prices would be quite close to each other, so the easiest way to do your analysis is to use the convention I listed above.<>In financial markets, the bid price is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a security, while the ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for the security. The difference between the bid and ask price is known as the bid-ask spread.Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on the price, volume, or open interest of a security or contract. They are used by traders to help identify trends, support and resistance levels, and potential buy and sell signals. Some common technical indicators include moving averages, the relative strength index (RSI), and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). Technical indicators can be used on their own or in combination with each other and with other forms of analysis to make more informed trading decisions.<>finance
