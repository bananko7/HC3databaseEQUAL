Why is my foreskin area dry ?I am 15 years old and have dry\/white skin under the head of my penis it is not on the head and is on my foreskin area. It does not hurt or itch but to me it is very unattractive, i have tried putting small amounts of vaseline on the affected area but it does not make it any better just not as rough. Do you have any info on this? I am still somewhat a virgin ie:no vag sex yet<>Hi!,Welcome To HealthcareMagic forum, I think what you mean is a whitish membrane or material over the glans penis.If this is so ,then you need not worry,it is called SMEGMA,It is completely normal to have this ,its just a over-secretion of sebaceous glands.You juts need to clean it with soap and water daily.Proper hygiene is  a must. regards,Dr.chawda<>It is normal for the skin on the foreskin to be a little bit dry. The skin on the penis and foreskin can be naturally dry and may require occasional moisturizing. Dry skin can be caused by a number of factors, including low humidity, hot showers, and using soap or other products that can strip the skin of its natural oils. If the dryness is severe or is accompanied by other symptoms such as redness, itching, or pain, it may be a sign of a skin condition or infection. If you are concerned about the dryness of your foreskin, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment. They will be able to advise you on the best course of action to take.<>medicine
