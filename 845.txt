Why are dogs so possesive over bones ? My dog will start crying if she ca n't find a place to hide her bone , and when she does , she goes back to check on it constantly Explain like I'm five.<>Evolutionary remnant . It represents food for her , a catch . In order to not have other dogs run off with it , her instincts tell her to hide it .<>Dogs can become very possessive over bones and other toys because they have a natural instinct to protect their resources. This is especially true when it comes to food, as in the wild, dogs had to compete with other animals for food and resources. By hiding their bones and checking on them constantly, dogs are simply trying to make sure that no one else takes their food. It's also possible that your dog has learned through past experiences that hiding her bones helps to keep them safe and secure. So when she can't find a place to hide her bone, she may become upset because she knows that it could be taken away from her.<>reddit_eli5
