Would selling significantly below market affect the value of a stock<>That amount of shares is too low to create \"ripples\" in the market. Usually you don't specify the price to sell the stock, unless you are personally on the floor trading the securities. And even then, with a volume of $50,000 it would just mean you threw away $45,000. For most people it would mean setting a $5 sell order, and the broker would understand that as \"sell this security so long the price is above $5\". When you get to the trading volume required to influence the price, usually you are also bound by some regulations banning some moves. One of them is the Pump and Dump, and even if you are suggesting the opposite, it might be in preparation of this scam. Also, the software used for High Frequency Trading (what all the cool kids[a] in Wall Street are using these days) employ advanced (and proprietary) heuristics to analyze the market and make thousands of trades in a short interval of time. On HTF's speed: Decisions happen in milliseconds, and this could result in big market moves without reason.  So a human trader attempting to manipulate the market versus these HTF setups, would be like a kid in a tricile attempting to outrun the Flash (DC comics). [a] Cool Kid: not really kids, more like suited up sharks. Money-eating sharks.<>Selling a stock at a significantly lower price than its market value could potentially have an impact on the stock's value. The stock market is driven by supply and demand, and if there is a sudden influx of a particular stock being sold at a lower price than what buyers are willing to pay, it could potentially decrease the demand for the stock and therefore its value.However, it's important to note that the stock market is complex and there are many factors that can influence a stock's value. A single sale of a stock at a lower price may not necessarily have a significant impact on the stock's overall value. Additionally, the impact of a sale on a stock's value may be temporary and the stock's value could potentially recover over time.It's also worth noting that the value of a stock can be influenced by a variety of other factors, such as the company's financial performance, industry conditions, and market trends. It's always a good idea to do thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.<>finance
