Defragmenting a hard drive , and what it means for the hard drive to be fragmented . I do n't understand what this really means . I realized I 've been running a defragmenter regularly without knowing what it was actually doing . Explain like I'm five.<>Let 's say you have a lunch box . When you go to school , your mom has already ( but hastily ) packed it for you . Every item in your lunch box takes up some space ( including some more than others ) . For example , your PB & J sandwich takes up 3 units of space , and your juice takes up 2 units of space , and your cookies take up 4 units of space . If we looked at a diagram , they might look like this : > [ .. [ sandwich][juice] .. [cookies ] .. ] > where a . = unit of free space Now , looking at this diagram , we can see that our total food \/ drinks takes up 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 units of space , and you have another 6 units of free space . Great ! Timmy Smith , who owns the biggest baseball card collection in the school , wants to give you his cards to hold for a couple days . Great ! He tells you that his cards take up 6 units of space . Reviewing our lunch box , we have 6 units of free space ! Therefore , we can take his cards and put them in our lunch box . But there is a problem . While we know that we * can technically * put his cards in the lunchbox , we do n't have the necessary room available due to the placement of other items in your lunchbox ( see the above diagram , there 's only 2 spaces of free space available individually , and we ca n't cut up his cards to fit in those spaces ! ) . So what is the solution to your mom 's hasty packing job ? We simply need to reorganize a bit ! Let 's take all your food \/ drink items and simply slide them all over to the left . Now our lunch box looks like this : > [ [ sandwich][juice][cookies ] ...... ] > where a . = unit of free space Now we have * 6 consecutive units of free space * , and we can take Timmy 's cards and fit them snugly in : > [ [ sandwich][juice][cookies][tim 's cards ] ] > there is now no free space * * * So , to elaborate upon the above analogy a bit , de - fragmenting your harddrive is meant to remove all those tiny little spaces in - between your files on your harddrive , and position them all together so you can fit larger files . Hope this helped .<>Sure! When a computer saves a file, it will store that file in different parts of the hard drive. This is because the hard drive might not have enough space in one spot to fit the entire file. Imagine a library where books are stored on shelves. If the library only had one shelf, it would quickly become cluttered and disorganized if the librarian tried to fit too many books on it. Instead, the librarian might spread the books out over several shelves to keep the library more organized. A hard drive works in a similar way. When you save a file, the hard drive will store it in different parts of the hard drive to keep everything organized and easy to find. However, as you use your computer and save more and more files, the hard drive can become cluttered and disorganized, just like the library with too many books on one shelf. This is what is meant by a fragmented hard drive. When a hard drive is fragmented, it means that the files on the hard drive are spread out and not stored in a continuous block of space. This can make it take longer for the computer to access and open the files, because it has to search through different parts of the hard drive to find all the pieces of the file. Defragmenting a hard drive is the process of reorganizing the files on the hard drive so that they are stored in a continuous block of space. This makes it easier and faster for the computer to access and open the files. Defragmenting a hard drive can help improve the overall performance of the computer.<>reddit_eli5
