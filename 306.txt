Is Prednisone effective in the treatment of cough and bronchitis?I have had an upper respiratory virus and cold with congestion, coughing Itchy irritated throat and malaise. Four weeks later still have some cough and congestion and seems to have settled into Bronchitis. Would a round of Prednisone help to clear this all the way up? Thank you, Rob<>Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Steroid is strong anti-inflammatory drug and short term Betamethasone BD dose for five days can be prescribed But before starting steroid Auscultation can be done and spirometry done If needed to assess severity. In cough for more than three week chest x ray also has to be done Take care Hope this will help you Consult pulmonologoist for examination<>Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication that can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including respiratory conditions such as cough and bronchitis. It can be effective in reducing inflammation in the airways and may help to relieve symptoms such as cough and congestion. However, prednisone is not a first-line treatment for bronchitis and is usually only used in cases where other treatments have not been effective.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that prednisone can have significant side effects and should be used only under the guidance of a healthcare provider. If you are experiencing symptoms of bronchitis, it's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can determine the most appropriate treatment based on the specific cause of your symptoms and your overall health. In the meantime, you can try some self-care measures such as getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter cough and cold medications to help relieve your symptoms.<>medicine
