Why ( e^Pi*i)+1=0 ? Or really why e^pi*i = -1 . why are e and pi related in that manner ? and how does the imaginary number come into play ? Please explain like I'm five.<>There was a very bright mathemetician who figured out that you can write ( almost ) any function as a polynomial that looks like * a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + .... + zx^n * where a , b , c , d , e , ... , z are all just numbers . For some functions this is really obvious : you can write f(x ) = ( x+3)(x-2 ) as a polynomial by just carrying out the math and finding that f(x ) = -6 + 1 x + 1 x^(2 ) . This is a really nice and well behaved function and its * Taylor series * has a finite number of terms . Some functions are slightly more complicated when you try to write them out . If you take the sine function , for example , then your series becomes sin(x ) = x - x^(3)\/3 ! + x^(5)\/5 ! - x^(7)\/7 ! + ... and so on , where each term has x^(the next odd number)\/(that same odd number ) ! with alternating signs . This polynomial has infinitely many terms , but it still works . Note that the terms are divided by 3 ! , 5 ! , 7 ! , and so on , which means that each term is much smaller than the previous one ( the ! operator is factorial ; 5 ! means 5\\*4\\*3\\*2\\*1 ; 7 ! means 7\\*6\\*5\\*4\\*3\\*2\\*1 ) , so this series is useful for approximating the function . We know from studying the geometric significance of sin(pi ) that sin(pi ) = 0 . The next Taylor series to look at is cosine . Cosine looks a lot like sine , but it 's slightly different : cos(x ) = 1 - x^(2)\/2 ! + x^(4)\/4 ! - x^(6)\/6 ! + ... and so on . Notice how this is the same thing as sine , but instead of using the odd powers it uses the even powers . We know from geometry that cos(pi ) = -1 . The final Taylor series to introduce is e^(x ) . This function looks like this : e^(x ) = 1 + x + x^(2)\/2 ! + x^(3)\/3 ! + x^(4)\/4 ! + ... and so on . This function uses all exponents , even or odd , and no terms are subtracted . When you look at sin(x ) and cos(x ) it seems like there ought to be a way to combine them . If you just add them up then you get something close , but you have the issue of half of the terms being negative : sin(x ) + cos(x ) = 1 + x - x^(2)\/2 - x^(3)\/3 + x^(4)\/4 + x^(5)\/5 - ... and so on . In order to get around this problem you start using * i * since i^2 = -1 and i^4 = 1 . If you take e^(ix ) then this just means that you have to put an \" i \" into the e^x series everywhere that there 's an x. This looks like this : e^(ix ) = 1 + ( ix ) + ( ix)^2\/2 ! + ( ix)^(3)\/3 ! + ( ix)^4\/4 ! + ... . Note that if you have something like ( ix)^6 then you can rewrite that as i^(6)\\*x^(6 ) , which can then be re - written as i^(4)\\*i^(2)\\*x^(6 ) , then you can use the fact that i^4 = 1 and i^2 = -1 to rewrite it as simply -(x^(6 ) ) . Applying that to the e^(ix ) series you have : e^(ix ) = 1 + ix - x^(2)\/2 ! - ix^(3)\/3 ! + x^(4)\/4 ! + i\\*x^(5)\/5 ! - ... and so on . Now look at all of the even exponents in that series : it 's just the cosine exponents ! We 're close now . If you pull out all of the even exponents then you have e^(ix ) - cos(x ) = ix - ix^(3)\/3 ! + ix^(5)\/5 ! - ix^(7)\/7 ! + ... and so on . This is just the sine series , but with an \" i \" multiplied through it , so this series is equal to i \\ * sin(x ) . Now we have e^(ix ) - cos(x ) = i \\ * sin(x ) . Putting the cosine back on the right side leaves us with what 's known as Euler 's formula or Euler 's identity : e^(i\\*x ) = cos(x ) + i\\*sin(x ) . From here all we have to do is drop in x = pi and see what happens . As mentioned earlier , we know that cos(pi ) = -1 and sin(pi ) = 0 , so we arrive at e^(i\\*pi ) = -1 + i\\*0 . EDIT : formatting . e^(ix ) ca n't be written with an asterisk without canceling the superscript with the escape character . TIL .<>The equation e^(Pii)+1=0 is true because the value of e^(Pii) is equal to -1, and when you add 1 to -1, the result is 0. The number \"e\" is a mathematical constant that is approximately equal to 2.71828. It is an important number in mathematics and appears in many different areas of math and science. The letter \"i\" represents the square root of -1, which is an imaginary number. The equation e^(Pii) represents the result of raising the number \"e\" to the power of Pii, which is a combination of the mathematical constant \"pi\" (approximately equal to 3.14159) and the imaginary number \"i\". The value of Pii is a complex number (a number that includes both a real part and an imaginary part). The reason that e^(Pii) is equal to -1 is because of the properties of the number \"e\" and the relationship between \"e\", \"pi\", and the imaginary number \"i\". This relationship can be explained using calculus and advanced mathematics, but it is beyond the scope of a simple explanation. I hope this helps!
