How does drug testing in jobs work in Colorado \/ Washington now that pot has been legalized ? Is marijuana exempt from drug tests now ? Can employers still discriminate based on pot use ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Exactly the same way it always has -- the law is very clear that employers can continue to test and punish employees who use pot , if they have a rule against it . The fact that you wo n't go to jail has very little to do with standards employers set for their employees .<>In Colorado and Washington, as in most states, it is legal for employers to drug test their employees. This means that if an employer thinks an employee is using drugs, including marijuana, they can require the employee to take a drug test. If the employee tests positive for drugs, the employer can take disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Just because marijuana is legal in these states does not mean that it is automatically acceptable for an employee to use it while on the job or to show up to work under the influence of marijuana. Employers are still allowed to have policies in place prohibiting the use of marijuana by their employees. It is also important to note that while marijuana may be legal for recreational use in Colorado and Washington, it is still illegal under federal law. This means that certain types of jobs, such as jobs with the federal government or jobs that require a security clearance, may have stricter rules about marijuana use, even if the employee is using it in a state where it is legal.<>reddit_eli5
