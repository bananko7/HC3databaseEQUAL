What is the standard deviation and mean return of oil?<>Your question is a moving target. And my answer will be subject to revision. I disagree with the votes to close, as you are asking (imho) what role commodities and specifically oil, play in one's asset allocation. Right? How much may be opinion, but there's a place to ask if.  I'm looking at this chart, and thinking, long term, the real return is zero. The discussion regarding gold has been pretty exhausted. For oil, it's not tough to make the case that it will fluctuate, but long term, there's no compelling reason to believe its price will rise any faster than inflation over the really long term.<>The standard deviation and mean return of oil can vary significantly over time. In general, the price of oil is influenced by a wide range of factors, including global economic conditions, political events, and natural disasters. As a result, the return on an investment in oil can be highly unpredictable.That being said, the standard deviation of oil returns can be quite high. For example, the annualized standard deviation of the return on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contracts has been as high as 50% in some years. The mean return on oil investments can also be highly variable, with some years seeing strong returns and others seeing significant losses.It is important to note that investing in oil carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Before making an investment in oil, it is important to carefully consider your financial goals and risk tolerance and to consult with a financial professional.<>finance
