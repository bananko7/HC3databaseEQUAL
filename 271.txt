What causes a white spot inside the nostrils?I am a 58 year old woman who just visited the dentist. In his office he is using a CT scan to get 3D pictures of the jaw, neck, face, etc. On mine, he noticed a white spot just to the side of my right nostril. What could this possibly be? He said I needed a more specific scan to that area to get a better picture. would a deviated septum show up like that?<>Hello,  Read your query, as you have white spot inside nostril it can be due to folliculitis , nasal polyp, sinusitis, or deviated nasal septum for this I will suggest you to consult ENT specialist and go for investigations like PNS view for deviated septum and its treatment.  Hope it will help you.  Wishing you good health.Regards,  Dr. Priyanka tiwari.<>There are several potential causes for a white spot inside the nostril. It is possible that the white spot is a benign growth, such as a nasal polyp or a wart. It could also be a sign of a fungal or bacterial infection. In some cases, the white spot may be caused by a condition called leukoplakia, which is a thickening of the skin inside the nostril. It is important to have the white spot evaluated by a medical professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nA deviated septum, which is a condition in which the bone and cartilage that divides the nostrils is crooked or misaligned, would not typically cause a white spot inside the nostril. However, it is possible that the white spot could be related to a deviated septum if it is a result of irritation or inflammation caused by the misalignment of the septum.\n\nIf the dentist has recommended a more specific scan to get a better picture of the white spot, it is important to follow through with this recommendation so that the cause of the white spot can be accurately identified and appropriate treatment can be provided.<>medicine
