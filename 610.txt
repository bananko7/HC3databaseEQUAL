Why should I not pull out my grey hairs ? Everyone always says to not pull out the grey hairs or twice as many will grow back ? Explain like I'm five.<>Because some of us have no hairs , so you should be greyteful<>Pulling out grey hairs will not cause more grey hairs to grow back in their place. The idea that plucking one grey hair will cause two more to grow in its place is a myth. In fact, repeatedly pulling out hairs can damage the hair follicle, which can lead to hair loss or thinning.\r\n\r\nHair grows in cycles, and when a hair is pulled out, a new hair will eventually replace it. The color of the new hair will depend on your natural hair color and genetics, not on whether or not you pulled out a grey hair. Some people may have a genetic tendency to go grey at a younger age, while others may not start going grey until much later.\r\n\r\nIt's completely normal to have some grey hairs as you get older. Some people choose to embrace their grey hairs and let them grow out, while others may choose to cover them with hair dye or other hair products. Ultimately, the decision is up to you and what makes you feel comfortable and confident.<>reddit_eli5
