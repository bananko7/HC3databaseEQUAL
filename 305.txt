When we laugh, we make a series of short, explosive sounds with our mouths. These sounds are called \"laughter.\"\r\n\r\nLaughter is a way for us to show that we are happy or amused. It's also a way for us to bond with other people and to release tension or stress. When we laugh, our bodies release chemicals called endorphins, which can help us feel good.\r\n\r\nWhen we laugh, our bodies also make a series of physical movements, such as smiling, crinkling our eyes, and possibly even snorting or guffawing. These movements are all part of the process of laughter.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, laughter is a natural response that we have when we are happy or amused, and it helps us feel good and bond with others.
