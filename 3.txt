what is bilirubin total<>Bilirubin (formerly referred to as hematoidin) is the yellow breakdown product of normal heme catabolism .<>Bilirubin is a yellowish substance that is produced when red blood cells break down. It is normally present in small amounts in the blood, but high levels of bilirubin can indicate a problem with the liver or other parts of the body's system for processing and eliminating waste products.\\n\\nTotal bilirubin refers to the sum of all the different types of bilirubin in the blood. It is typically measured as part of a liver function test or as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel, which is a group of tests that measure various substances in the blood to assess the overall health of the body's organs and systems.\\n\\nElevated levels of total bilirubin can be a sign of liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, or other conditions that affect the liver's ability to function properly. It can also be caused by certain medications or conditions that affect the breakdown of red blood cells, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia.\\n\\nIf you have questions about your bilirubin levels or are concerned about liver health, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance.","Bilirubin is a yellowish substance that is produced when red blood cells break down. It is normally present in the blood in small amounts and is removed from the body through the liver, which processes it and excretes it into the bile. The total bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood.\\n\\nElevated levels of bilirubin in the blood, also known as hyperbilirubinemia, can be a sign of liver disease or other underlying health conditions. High levels of bilirubin can cause the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow, a condition called jaundice.\\n\\nThe total bilirubin test is usually ordered as part of a liver function panel or as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel. It is typically measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL). Normal levels of total bilirubin in the blood range from 0.3 to 1.9 mg\/dL. However, the normal range may vary slightly depending on the laboratory that performs the test.\\n\\nIf the total bilirubin level is elevated, further testing may be needed to determine the cause and to guide treatment. These tests may include a direct bilirubin test, which measures the amount of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, or a liver function panel to assess the overall function of the liver.","Bilirubin total is a blood test that measures the total amount of bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance that is produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells. It is carried by the bloodstream to the liver, where it is processed and excreted from the body in the bile.\\n\\nElevated levels of bilirubin in the blood, known as hyperbilirubinemia, can be a sign of liver problems, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, or other conditions that affect the red blood cells, such as hemolytic anemia. A bilirubin total test may be ordered as part of a liver function panel or as part of a general health examination. The normal range for bilirubin total is typically 0.3 to 1.9 milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL).<>open_qa
