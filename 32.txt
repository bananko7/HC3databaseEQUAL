For what dates are the NYSE and U.S. stock exchanges typically closed?<>All public US equity exchanges are closed on the 9 US trading holidays (see below) and open on all other days.  Exchanges also close early (13:00 ET) on the Friday after Thanksgiving and on the day before Independence Day if Independence Day is being observed on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.  (Some venues have extended trading hours as a matter of course; for them an \"early close\" might be later than 13:00 ET.) To answer the second question, yes, if you know NASDAQ's or AMEX's holiday schedule, then you know NYSE's (modulo the timing of their early close).  I'm not sure about the options exchanges; they're not regulated the same way and are a good example of exchanges with extended trading hours in the first place. The US trading holidays are as follows.  Note that trading holidays are not the same as federal or bank holidays, which include Columbus Day and Veterans Day but do not include Good Friday.<>The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and other U.S. stock exchanges are typically closed on certain holidays each year. These holidays include:New Year's Day (January 1)Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday in January)Presidents' Day (third Monday in February)Good Friday (Friday before Easter)Memorial Day (last Monday in May)Independence Day (July 4)Labor Day (first Monday in September)Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November)Christmas Day (December 25)In addition to these holidays, the NYSE and other U.S. stock exchanges may also close early on the day before certain holidays or on other special occasions. It's always a good idea to check with the exchange or with your brokerage firm to confirm the trading schedule for a particular day.<>finance
