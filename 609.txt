Please explain what is \"Sequential pattern mining\"<>Sequential pattern mining is a topic of data mining concerned with finding statistically relevant patterns between data examples where the values are delivered in a sequence. It is usually presumed that the values are discrete, and thus time series mining is closely related, but usually considered a different activity.  Sequential pattern mining is a special case of structured data mining.\nThere are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field.  These include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information, extracting the frequently occurring patterns, comparing sequences for similarity, and recovering missing sequence members.  In general, sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms  and itemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning. Local process models  extend sequential pattern mining to more complex patterns that can include (exclusive) choices, loops, and concurrency constructs in addition to the sequential ordering construct.<>Sequential pattern mining is a process of finding patterns in data that are ordered in some way. It is a type of data mining that involves searching for patterns in sequential data, such as time series, transaction data, or other types of ordered data.\n\n\n\nIn sequential pattern mining, the goal is to identify patterns that occur frequently in the data. These patterns can be used to make predictions about future events, or to understand the underlying structure of the data.\n\n\n\nThere are several algorithms and techniques that can be used for sequential pattern mining, including the Apriori algorithm, the ECLAT algorithm, and the SPADE algorithm. These algorithms use various techniques to identify patterns in the data, such as counting the frequency of items or looking for correlations between items.\n\n\n\nSequential pattern mining has a wide range of applications, including market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. It can be used to understand customer behavior, predict future events, and identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent in the data.<>wiki_csai
