Is there land that is n't owned ? Can I acquire land without buying through a real estate agent ? Does the government own the land ? How do real estate agents get the land to sell ? How could I get land from the government ? Explain like I'm five.<>In the United States , land that is n't owned by a private entity is deemed \" public land , \" and thus is owned by the public . However , the federal government essentially says , \" let us take care of this for you , \" so the land is held \" in trust \" by the federal government , and is primarily managed by the [ Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) ] ( URL_2 ) , and the [ National Forest Service ] ( URL_3 ) . Other federal agencies control other portions of public land . More info on public land in the United States [ here ] ( URL_1 ) . So , land in the United States is either owned by private entity or the federal government . And the BLM does occasionally sell land , but do n't count on it . [ More info here ] ( URL_0 )<>There is land that is not privately owned, but rather is owned by the government or a public entity. This land is usually managed by a government agency and is not available for individuals to purchase. Instead, the government may allow people to use the land for specific purposes, such as camping or recreation.\n\nThere are also some areas of land that are not claimed by any particular person or group, such as certain areas of wilderness or uninhabited islands. However, it is generally not possible to simply claim ownership of such land.\n\nIn most cases, if you want to acquire land, you will need to purchase it through a real estate agent or directly from the owner. Real estate agents typically work with landowners to help them sell their properties. They may also help buyers find properties that meet their needs and negotiate the terms of the sale.\n\nIf you want to obtain land from the government, you may be able to do so through a government program or by leasing the land for a specific purpose. For example, the government may make land available for farming or for the development of renewable energy sources. You would typically need to apply for such opportunities and meet certain requirements to be eligible.<>reddit_eli5
