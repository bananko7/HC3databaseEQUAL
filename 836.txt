How to cure seizures permanently?My daughter has taken Topamax for seizures. She quit taken the meds several months ago and her seizures are coming back more frequently then before. She said her insurance will not cover them anymore. What should I do ? She just had another seizure today.<>welcome to HCM!From my clinical expeirnece I can tell you that your daughter should start the medicine as soon as possible. As you mentioned that her seizures are back with more intensity, and the nature is different now, so , you should preffrably  see a neurologist and take consultation before starting drugs. She should also get an MRI brain to rule out any organicity, get her liver function test and blood counts (prior to starting drugs). I know it is very difficult to take long term medication but it is really important for her to remain seizure free. Every seizure destroys some brain cells, and thereby making her prone to get more of them. Apart from drugs you should see that she dosent drive for some time now, operates machinery under supervision.Please try to cut expenses on other things and ask her to take medicine, she needs them. Donot stop the drugs without consulting the doctor.Hope the reply is usefulDr. Manisha Gopal<>I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's seizures. Seizures can be a serious condition, and it's important to seek medical treatment to find the best course of action for managing them. It's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to experience seizures even while taking medication, and it's important to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution for treating seizures, as the best approach will depend on the individual's specific needs and medical history. In some cases, medication can be effective in controlling seizures, while in other cases, surgery or other treatments may be necessary.\n\nIf your daughter's insurance is no longer covering the medication she has been taking, it's important to speak with her healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. They may be able to recommend alternative medications that are covered by your insurance, or they may suggest other treatment options. It's also important to make sure that your daughter is seeing a healthcare provider regularly to monitor her condition and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to take steps to ensure your daughter's safety during a seizure, such as removing any potential hazards from the area and placing her in a safe position. It's also a good idea to have a seizure action plan in place in case of future seizures. This should include the contact information for your daughter's healthcare provider and any other important information, such as what to do if she has a prolonged seizure.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or concerns, I encourage you to speak with your daughter's healthcare provider for more personalized guidance.<>medicine
