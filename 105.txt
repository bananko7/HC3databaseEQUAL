Why do words like Aisle , Isle , and Island , have a silent \" s \" ? I want to know the origin behind this . Please explain like I'm five.<>Not every word in English came originally from the English people . A lot of modern English words come from the French via the Normans , Germans , Dutch and the Romans . The folks at r \/ words would probably be a better source . Aisle came from the old French word ele , which evolved into the modern French word aile . Island is from the old English word igland , which further came from a proto - german word and from before that PIE ( Proto - Indo - European ) language . I think these might be of interest to you URL_1 URL_0<>These words all have a silent \"s\" because they come from Old French and Latin, and in those languages, the \"s\" was pronounced differently than it is in English. For example, the word \"aisle\" comes from the Old French \"aisle,\" which came from the Latin \"ala,\" which means \"wing.\" The word \"isle\" comes from the Old French \"isle,\" which also came from the Latin \"insula,\" which means \"island.\" The word \"island\" comes from the Old English \"igland,\" which comes from the Old Norse \"eyland,\" which means \"island.\"Over time, the way that these words were pronounced changed, and the \"s\" became silent in English. This happens sometimes with words that come from other languages. Even though the \"s\" is not pronounced, it is still part of the word and helps to spell it correctly.<>reddit_eli5
