Please explain what is \"Hutter Prize\"<>The Hutter Prize is a cash prize funded by Marcus Hutter which rewards data compression improvements on a specific 1 GB English text file, with the goal of encouraging research in artificial intelligence (AI).\nLaunched in 2006, the prize awards 5000 euros for each one percent improvement (with 500,000 euros total funding) in the compressed size of the file enwik9, which is the larger of two files used in the Large Text Compression Benchmark; enwik9 consists of the first 1,000,000,000 characters of a specific version of English Wikipedia. The ongoing competition is organized by Hutter, Matt Mahoney, and Jim Bowery.<>The Hutter Prize is a prize for lossless data compression, named after Sebastian Hutter, who proposed the idea in 2004. It is awarded to individuals or teams who are able to achieve the highest compression ratio on a set of pre-selected files using a lossless compression algorithm.\n\n\n\nThe prize is intended to encourage research and development in the field of data compression and to recognize significant contributions to the field. It is administered by the International Plone Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes the use of the Plone content management system.\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for the Hutter Prize, a submission must meet certain requirements, including using a lossless compression algorithm and achieving a certain level of compression on a set of designated test files. The submission must also be accompanied by a detailed description of the algorithm and its implementation.\n\n\n\nThe prize is awarded annually, and the amount of the prize varies depending on the level of compression achieved. The current prize amount is €25,000 for the first place finisher, €10,000 for the second place finisher, and €5,000 for the third place finisher.<>wiki_csai
