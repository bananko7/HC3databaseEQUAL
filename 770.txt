Self - immolation as a form of protest Another day , another story about Tibetian monks setting themselves on fire to protest something . I have no idea how that 's supposed to protest anything - is it just a cultural thing ? Explain like I'm five.<>Let 's say you want to show the world that you 're really angry at your treatment . REALLY angry . Like , psychopathically angry . What would be a good way to do that ? Well , you could go on a big terrorist rampage to show your dismay . But for a certain type of person , killing others who are either innocent , or just doing their job for an authoritarian regime , is n't very palatable . What 's another way of making a VERY strong statement about how angry you are ? How about purposely subjecting yourself to intense agony , in a very spectactular and visible way ? That 's what self - immolation is . It 's probably the strongest possible way of telling people how angry you are .<>Self-immolation is the act of setting oneself on fire as a form of protest or as a way to make a statement. It is a very extreme and dangerous form of protest that is not common in most parts of the world. In the case of Tibetan monks, some have engaged in self-immolation to protest against the Chinese government's treatment of Tibet and its people. They believe that by setting themselves on fire, they can draw attention to the issues facing Tibet and the Tibetan people, and bring about change. Self-immolation is a very serious and tragic act, and it is not an appropriate or effective way to protest or bring about change. It is important to find peaceful and non-violent ways to express our views and to work towards positive change in the world.<>reddit_eli5
