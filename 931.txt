Is it natural to have hard lump on forehead after fall?I have a hard lump on forehead after fall 2 weeks ago is it natural for it to still be here? i was taken to A&E and they sent me home without a brain scan as the Doctor thought it unnecessary i had the biggest black eye I ve ever seen, feeling a little of colour today<>Hi there, as you had fall 2 weeks back and I suppose you are not having neurological issues like one sided weakness, giddiness, prolonged headache etc, so CT scan is not necessary as per information provided by you. And about your lump , suppose after fall if there is any local subcutneous bleed swelling (lump) will occur, it will be prominent if  any bone present behind the swelling., it will take sometime to comedown, if its not coming down consult your doctor. For any such kind of queries you can ask me. Thank you.<>It is possible for a bump or lump to appear on your forehead after a fall. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as swelling, bruising, or a bone fracture. It is not uncommon for a bump or lump to persist for several weeks after an injury, especially if it is a more severe injury. However, it is important to be evaluated by a healthcare provider if you are concerned about the bump or if you are experiencing any other unusual symptoms following the fall. It is also important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing a change in your mental status, such as confusion or difficulty speaking, as these could be signs of a more serious injury.<>medicine
