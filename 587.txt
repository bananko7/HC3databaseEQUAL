Is issuer's bank allowed to charge fee when cashing check?<>Some banks charge their own customers if they make use of a teller. That is what you are doing. You are going to a bank where you are not a customer and requesting a transaction that requires a teller. If you cash the check by going though your bank, the issuer's bank only handles it as a non-teller transaction.<>It is possible for a bank to charge a fee for cashing a check, but whether or not they are allowed to do so depends on the specific circumstances of the transaction and the terms of the bank's account agreements. Some banks may charge a fee for cashing a check for non-customers, or for cashing a check that is drawn on a bank other than their own. Additionally, some banks may charge a fee for cashing a large check, or for cashing a check that is not a standard personal or business check.It is always a good idea to check with the bank to understand any fees that may be associated with cashing a check, and to consider whether alternative options, such as depositing the check into your account, might be more cost-effective. It is also a good idea to review the terms of your bank account agreement, as this will outline any fees that the bank is permitted to charge for various services.<>finance
