Is sore palate can be a result of post nasal drip?Can a sore palate be a result of post nasal drip. pseudophed helps.<>I have an extremely sore palate at the roof of my mouth. It is irritated & aggrevated by hot food and salt. I've had two teeth extracted this week and have been told to use hot salty water to aid the healing process, i can't do this as the pain is excruciating and salt aggrevates even more. I also have a cold sore on my lip. What do you think is the cause of the sore palate at the roof of my mouth & are there any home remedies or cures or something i can buy over the counter?<>Yes, a sore palate (the roof of the mouth) can be a result of post nasal drip. Post nasal drip is a condition in which mucus from the sinuses drains down the back of the throat, often causing irritation and inflammation. This can lead to a sore palate, as well as other symptoms such as a sore throat, cough, and congestion.\n\nPseudoephedrine is a medication that can help to alleviate symptoms of post nasal drip by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages and reducing inflammation. It is often used in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms of sinusitis, allergies, and the common cold. However, it is important to note that pseudoephedrine can have side effects and may not be suitable for everyone. It is always a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication.<>medicine
