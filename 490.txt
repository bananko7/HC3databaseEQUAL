if a man who identified completely as male had breast implants which were identical to a woman 's , would it be illegal for him to publicly show off his chest ? Would he be able to strut his rack proudly ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I remember an episode of some show where they followed a M2F transgendered person through the process . They did n't censor anything until some arbitrary point during the breast implant surgery when , suddenly , the nipple that moments ago was considered to be a man 's had to be blurred because a woman 's nipple ca n't be shown on TV . I 'm not sure how that would apply to a case of public indecency , but I figure it 's an interesting anecdote on the subject . Of course , as others have pointed out , it comes down to local laws first and foremost . It 's only a conundrum if you 're in a place where woman are n't allowed to be topless but men are .<>It would not be illegal for a man to publicly show off his chest after having breast implants, whether or not the implants were identical to those of a woman. In general, people are allowed to do what they want with their own bodies, as long as they are not hurting anyone else. This means that a man can choose to have breast implants if he wants to, and he can show off his chest if he wants to. Some people might not understand or agree with his choices, but as long as he is not breaking any laws, he can do what he likes.<>reddit_eli5
