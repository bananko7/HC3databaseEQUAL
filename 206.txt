Wish you a good health<>Elevated levels of SGPT (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase), also known as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), can be a sign of liver damage or disease. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThere are many potential causes of elevated SGPT, including viral infections such as hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and certain medications. In your case, it is possible that the dengue fever you had may have contributed to the elevation in your SGPT level.\n\nIt is important to follow the advice of your healthcare provider and to undergo further testing to determine the underlying cause of your elevated SGPT. This may include blood tests, imaging studies, and possibly a liver biopsy. Treatment may involve medications, lifestyle changes, or in some cases, surgery.\n\nIt is also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including eating a well-balanced diet, avoiding alcohol or limiting consumption, and exercising regularly to support liver health.<>medicine
