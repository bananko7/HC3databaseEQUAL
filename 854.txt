Please explain what is \"Charles Babbage\"<>Charles Babbage KH FRS (\/ˈbæbɪdʒ\/; 26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.\nBabbage is considered by some to be \"father of the computer\". Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine, that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom. Babbage had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers covered in his book Economy of Manufactures and Machinery. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as \"pre-eminent\" among the many polymaths of his century.\nBabbage, who died before the complete successful engineering of many of his designs, including his Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, remained a prominent figure in the ideating of computing. Parts of Babbage's incomplete mechanisms are on display in the Science Museum in London. In 1991, a functioning difference engine was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.<>Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, inventor, and mechanical engineer who is best known for his work on mechanical computers. He is considered to be the \"father of the computer\" because of his contributions to the design of the first mechanical computer, which he called the \"Difference Engine.\"\n\n\n\nBabbage was born in 1791 in London, England. He was a brilliant mathematician and was elected to the Royal Society at the age of 31. In 1812, he proposed the design of a mechanical machine that could perform mathematical calculations, which he called the \"Difference Engine.\" This machine was intended to be used to calculate and print tables of mathematical functions, such as logarithmic and trigonometric tables, which were used extensively in science and engineering at the time.\n\n\n\nBabbage worked on the design and construction of the Difference Engine for many years, but he was unable to complete it due to a lack of funding and technical difficulties. Despite this, Babbage's work on the Difference Engine laid the foundation for the development of the modern computer. He is also credited with designing the first programmable computer, which he called the \"Analytical Engine.\"\n\n\n\nBabbage died in 1871, but his contributions to the field of computer science have had a lasting impact and continue to be recognized today.<>wiki_csai
