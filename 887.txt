Why do some online stores not ask for the 3-digit code on the back of my credit card?<>The truth is that Visa does not require a merchant to enter the cvv number before authorizing a transaction.  The only information that is really needed is the credit card number and expiration date.<>There are a few reasons why some online stores may not ask for the 3-digit code on the back of your credit card:The 3-digit code, also known as the CVV (Card Verification Value) or CVC (Card Verification Code), is an additional security measure designed to protect against fraud. Some online stores may not ask for the CVV as they have other measures in place to verify the authenticity of the transaction.Some online stores may not ask for the CVV if they are using a payment gateway that does not require it. A payment gateway is a service that processes credit card transactions on behalf of the merchant. Some payment gateways do not require the CVV as part of the transaction process.Some online stores may not ask for the CVV if the transaction is being processed through a secure channel, such as a virtual terminal or a secure payment page. In these cases, the security of the transaction is already established, and the CVV may not be necessary.Overall, it is generally a good idea to provide the CVV whenever possible, as it helps to protect against fraud and ensure the security of your credit card transactions.<>finance
