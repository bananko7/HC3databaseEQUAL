It is the official language of Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union.\n\n\n\nHungarian is a member of the Finno-Ugric language family, which also includes Finnish, Estonian, and several other languages spoken in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Hungarian is not closely related to any of the major Indo-European languages, such as English, French, German, or Russian. As a result, it can be quite difficult for speakers of Indo-European languages to learn Hungarian, as it has a unique grammar and vocabulary.\n\n\n\nThe Hungarian alphabet consists of 44 letters and is written using the Latin script. Hungarian has a number of unique features, including a system of vowel harmony, a complex system of grammatical case, and a number of agglutinative suffixes that are added to words to indicate tense, aspect, and other grammatical information.\n\n\n\nHungarian is spoken primarily in Hungary, but there are also significant Hungarian-speaking communities in several other countries, including Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Austria. It is also spoken by smaller communities of Hungarian speakers in other parts of Europe and around the world.<>wiki_csai
