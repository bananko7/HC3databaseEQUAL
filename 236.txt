Can stress cause erectile issues?Recently my boyfriend and I were having sex and he suddenly got soft in the middle of it. He has been stressed out about money and not sleeping very much so I thought it was that, but I can't help thinking he isn't interested. Can stress cause erectile issues?<>Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Sex is largely what happens between two ears and two minds and not that happens between two legs. There are many possible reasons leading to erectile dysfunction and commonest is stress or performance anxiety. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This diminishes arousal level and hence erection too. This seems more likely with your partner. Both of you can go for counseling with sex therapist if this happens repeatedly.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Chintan Raval<>Yes, stress can cause erectile issues. Erectile dysfunction, also known as ED, is a common problem that can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress. Stress can affect your body's ability to relax, which can make it difficult to achieve and maintain an erection. Additionally, stress can lead to feelings of anxiety and worry, which can also contribute to ED. It's important to note that ED is not uncommon and can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical and psychological issues. If your boyfriend has been experiencing stress and is having difficulty getting or maintaining an erection, it's a good idea for him to speak with a healthcare provider. The provider can help determine the cause of the problem and recommend appropriate treatment options.<>medicine
