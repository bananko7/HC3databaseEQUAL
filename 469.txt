Please explain what is \"Generalized linear model\"<>In statistics, a generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.\nGeneralized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. They proposed an iteratively reweighted least squares method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters. MLE remains popular and is the default method on many statistical computing packages. Other approaches, including Bayesian regression and least squares fitting to variance stabilized responses, have been developed.<>A generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible statistical model that can be used to analyze a wide range of data types. It is an extension of the linear regression model, which is used to model the relationship between a continuous response variable and one or more predictor variables.\n\n\n\nThe key difference between a linear regression model and a GLM is that in a GLM, the response variable is not necessarily continuous and may follow a different distribution, such as a binomial, poisson, or gamma distribution. The GLM allows for the modeling of this type of data by using a link function to relate the mean of the response variable to a linear combination of the predictor variables.\n\n\n\nIn a GLM, the response variable is assumed to follow a certain distribution, and the mean of this distribution is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables. The parameters of the model are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the data, which is the probability of observing the data given the model.\n\n\n\nExamples of GLMs include logistic regression for modeling binary data, Poisson regression for modeling count data, and gamma regression for modeling continuous data with a positive skew.<>wiki_csai
