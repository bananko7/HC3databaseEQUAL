Please explain what is \"Peter Dayan\"<>Peter Dayan FRS is director at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Germany. He is co-author of Theoretical Neuroscience, an influential textbook on computational neuroscience. He is known for applying Bayesian methods from machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand neural function and is particularly recognized for relating neurotransmitter levels to prediction errors and Bayesian uncertainties. He has pioneered the field of reinforcement learning (RL) where he helped develop the Q-learning algorithm, and made contributions to unsupervised learning, including the wake-sleep algorithm for neural networks and the Helmholtz machine.<>Peter Dayan is a British neuroscientist and computational biologist. He is currently the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Germany, and a Professor of Computational Neuroscience at the University of Tübingen.\n\n\n\nDayan received his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Oxford, and went on to earn a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Edinburgh. After completing his Ph.D., he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sussex before moving to the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, where he worked with Terry Sejnowski on developing computational models of the nervous system.\n\n\n\nDayan's research interests include computational and theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, and decision making. He has made significant contributions to our understanding of how the brain processes information, learns, and makes decisions, and has developed influential models of learning and decision making in the brain. In addition to his research, Dayan is also a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences.<>wiki_csai
