if the US congress has less than a 10 % approval rating , why have n't we fired them ? I have n't seen or heard of a petition or movement to do this . There has to be a legal precedence . Explain like I'm five.<>A great many people believe that \" their guy \" is the only good one in congress . Since that 's the only one they CAN vote for , he gets reelected , and the electorate continues to complain about all the \" other guys \" .<>The United States Congress, which is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, is a branch of the federal government. Members of Congress are elected by the people to represent their interests and make laws on their behalf.\r\n\r\nEven if the approval rating of Congress is low, it is not possible to simply \"fire\" the members of Congress the way you might fire an employee. In the United States, we have a system of government called democracy, which means that the people elect their representatives to make decisions on their behalf. If the people are not happy with the way their representatives are doing their job, they can vote them out of office by choosing someone else to represent them in the next election.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to remember that Congress is made up of many different people with different ideas and perspectives. It is not uncommon for there to be disagreement and debate within Congress about how to best address the issues facing the country. This can sometimes lead to a low approval rating, even if the members of Congress are working hard and trying to do what they believe is best for their constituents and the country as a whole.<>reddit_eli5
