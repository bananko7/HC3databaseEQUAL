Please explain what is \"Gene Ontology\"<>The Gene Ontology (GO) is a major bioinformatics initiative to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species. More specifically, the project aims to: 1) maintain and develop its controlled vocabulary of gene and gene product attributes; 2) annotate genes and gene products, and assimilate and disseminate annotation data; and 3) provide tools for easy access to all aspects of the data provided by the project, and to enable functional interpretation of experimental data using the GO, for example via enrichment analysis. GO is part of a larger classification effort, the Open Biomedical Ontologies, being one of the Initial Candidate Members of the OBO Foundry.\nWhereas gene nomenclature focuses on gene and gene products, the Gene Ontology focuses on the function of the genes and gene products.  The GO also extends the effort by using markup language to make the data (not only of the genes and their products but also of curated attributes) machine readable, and to do so in a way that is unified across all species (whereas gene nomenclature conventions vary by biological taxon).<>Gene Ontology (GO) is a standardized vocabulary for annotating genes and their functions in different organisms. It was developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium, a group of biologists, bioinformaticians, and data scientists who work to improve the interoperability of biological data.\n\n\n\nThe Gene Ontology consists of three main categories of terms: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. Molecular function describes the specific biochemical activity of a gene product, such as catalyzing a chemical reaction or binding to a particular molecule. Cellular component refers to the location or structure in which a gene product functions, such as a membrane or organelle. Biological process describes the larger processes in which a gene product is involved, such as cell division or immune response.\n\n\n\nGO terms are organized in a hierarchical structure, with more specific terms being subsumed under more general terms. For example, the term \"enzyme activity\" is a more general term that includes more specific terms like \"kinase activity\" and \"phosphatase activity.\" This hierarchical structure allows for a consistent and systematic way of annotating and organizing gene functions.\n\n\n\nGO is used by researchers to annotate and classify genes in order to understand their functions and roles in different biological processes. It is a widely used resource in the field of bioinformatics and is often used in conjunction with other databases and tools to analyze and interpret large-scale genomic data.<>wiki_csai
