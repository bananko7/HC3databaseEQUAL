Will cough affects blood donation?I have had a cough since December 28.  I have been on 2 courses of different antibiotics and it still hasn't gone away.  I am taking a cough suppressent now which helps a little but I have an appointment to donate blood today.  Can I still donate with a cough?<>hi if you are not suffering from any major illness and cough is simple without expectoration without fever then you can donate the blood, but if you have cough with fever and other disease then you can not donate blood. so go to your blood bank and let them examine you. simple cough has no effect on blood transfusion.thanks for using health care magic.<>It is generally not recommended to donate blood while you have a cough, as the cough could potentially be a sign of an infection or illness. If you have taken antibiotics and the cough has not improved, it is important to follow up with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of the cough and address any underlying issues.\n\nIf you are feeling well enough to donate blood and your cough is not severe, you may be able to donate blood as long as you do not have a fever or any other symptoms of illness. However, it is ultimately up to the discretion of the blood donation center to determine whether you are eligible to donate. It is important to be honest about your cough and any other symptoms you may be experiencing when you go to donate blood. If you are not able to donate due to your cough, you may be able to donate at a later date once your cough has improved.<>medicine
