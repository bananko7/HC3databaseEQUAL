why is hyperthermia extra dangerous with a low body weight ? Does this relate to body surface area or is there another reason underweight people should be extra careful ? I 've tried googling it but ca n't find the answer ... Please explain like I'm five.<>When you run a fever , your body tries to release sweat to cool itself . Your at risk for low fluid volume , especially if you have low body weight . Low fluid volume causes dehydration and may result in electrolyte imbalances Eli5 : drink more water !<>Hyperthermia, or a high body temperature, can be dangerous for anyone, but it may be more dangerous for people with a low body weight for a few reasons. One reason is that people with a low body weight may have a smaller body surface area, which means they have less skin to dissipate heat. This means that it can be harder for their body to cool itself down and maintain a normal body temperature. Another reason is that people with a low body weight may be more sensitive to the effects of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. These conditions can occur when the body gets too hot and can't cool itself down, and they can be serious or even life-threatening. So, it's important for people with a low body weight to be extra careful and take steps to avoid getting too hot, such as staying in a cool place, wearing lightweight clothing, and staying hydrated. If you start to feel too hot or have symptoms like dizziness, headache, or muscle cramps, it's important to get to a cool place and drink plenty of fluids.<>reddit_eli5
