After the 4 day we have sent his blood for tests and now his potassium is showing 6.3 .  Ha also had fever and cough because of which he is taking dualin and buedecort.<>Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. 6.3 potassium is too high.2. Meet your doctor immediately. High potassium can cause myocardial infarction. Stop taking any potassium immediately.3. After it comes back to normal, increase potassium in diet through nuts, legumes, fish, banana, apricots, etc.4. Not related to fever or medication. Discuss with your doctor to control potassium level immediately.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again.<>Low potassium levels, also known as hypokalemia, can be treated with oral potassium supplements or intravenous (IV) potassium. The treatment will depend on the severity of the hypokalemia and any underlying causes. If your father's potassium levels have already been corrected and are now in the normal range, it is important to continue taking any prescribed medications and to follow a healthy diet that includes foods rich in potassium, such as bananas, avocados, nuts, and leafy green vegetables.\n\nIt is also important to identify and treat any underlying causes of the hypokalemia. This may involve addressing any medical conditions or medications that may be contributing to the low potassium levels. If your father is taking medications for fever and cough, it is important to discuss the potential side effects of these medications with his healthcare provider, as some medications can cause low potassium levels as a side effect.\n\nIt is important to follow up with your father's healthcare provider to monitor his potassium levels and ensure that they remain in the normal range. The healthcare provider may recommend additional treatment or lifestyle changes if needed to help maintain normal potassium levels.<>medicine
