Please explain what is \"Computer security\"<>Computer security, cybersecurity (cyber security), or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from attack by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.\nThe field has become of significance due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things (IoT). Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the contemporary world, due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support. Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern large-scale systems with far-reaching physical effects, such as power distribution, elections, and finance.<>Computer security is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, theft, and damage. It involves a range of measures and techniques designed to secure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems.\n\n\n\nComputer security involves the use of technologies, processes, and policies to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information. It includes measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and other forms of cybercrime. It also involves measures to protect against unauthorized physical access to computer systems and data centers.\n\n\n\nEffective computer security requires a combination of technical measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption, as well as non-technical measures, such as user awareness training, security policies, and incident response plans. It is an ongoing process that involves regularly reviewing, updating, and testing security measures to ensure that they remain effective in protecting against evolving threats.<>wiki_csai
