Suggest medication for thrombocytopeniaDoctor, I m suffering the desease from 8 months.now also there is no change for the condition. And for me APS is thriple positive. Different types of antibodies are there including anticardiolipid antibody...thrombocytopenia whoch reduce the platele t count etc.. Please advise me.<>Hi there,Only if your platelet count is less than 20000\/cmm you will need treatment in the form of steroids. Otherwise there is no need to treat thrombocytopenia. If APLA is incidentally detected, no treatment is need for that.You are at higher risk of developing clots in blood vessels. Hence in high risk situations you will need thromboprophylaxis.Please consult a rheumatologist, and get tested for autoimmune conditions such as SLE. You may need a treatment, if found positive.With regards,Dr. Girish Kamat<>I'm sorry, but I am an artificial intelligence and I am not licensed to practice medicine or prescribe medications. It is important that you speak with a healthcare professional about your specific medical condition and treatment options. Thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, can have a variety of causes and it is important to determine the underlying cause in order to determine the most appropriate treatment. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is a condition in which abnormal antibodies are produced that can increase the risk of blood clots, is often treated with blood thinners such as warfarin or heparin. However, the specific treatment plan will depend on the severity of your condition and any other underlying medical conditions you may have. It is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare provider and to keep all of your follow-up appointments.","Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which the body has a low platelet count. Platelets are a type of blood cell that help the blood to clot. A low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.\n\nThere are many possible causes of thrombocytopenia, including certain medications, viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. The appropriate treatment for thrombocytopenia will depend on the underlying cause.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, it is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare provider. This may include medications to increase the platelet count, such as corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin. In some cases, platelet transfusions may be necessary.\n\nIf you have a condition known as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is characterized by the presence of certain antibodies, your healthcare provider may also recommend medications to prevent blood clots, such as aspirin or blood thinners.\n\nIt is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare provider and to seek medical attention if you experience any bleeding or bruising that is unusual for you.","I'm sorry to hear that you have been suffering from thrombocytopenia for 8 months. Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which there is a low number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are important for blood clotting, so having a low number of them can lead to bleeding and bruising.\n\nThere are several medications that can be used to treat thrombocytopenia, depending on the underlying cause of the condition. Some of these medications include:\n\nCorticosteroids: These medications, such as prednisone, can help to increase the production of platelets in the bone marrow.\n\nImmunoglobulins: These medications, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), can help to increase the number of platelets in the blood by suppressing the immune system.\n\nPlatelet transfusions: If the platelet count is very low, a platelet transfusion may be necessary to increase the number of platelets in the blood.\n\nThrombopoietin receptor agonists: These medications, such as eltrombopag and romiplostim, can help to increase the production of platelets in the bone marrow.\n\nIt is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment approach for your specific case. If you have APS (antiphospholipid syndrome), which is a condition in which the body produces abnormal antibodies that increase the risk of blood clots, your healthcare provider may recommend additional treatments, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners) to reduce the risk of blood clots.\n\nI recommend that you speak with your healthcare provider about the specific treatment options that are available to you, as well as any potential risks and benefits of each option.<>medicine
