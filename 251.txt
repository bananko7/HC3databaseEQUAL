It's important to have any lump evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. Some possible causes of a neck lump include:\n\nEnlarged lymph nodes: Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the immune system. They can sometimes become enlarged due to infection, inflammation, or other conditions.\n\nThyroid nodules: The thyroid gland is located in the neck and can sometimes form small, noncancerous lumps called nodules.\n\nCysts: A cyst is a sac-like structure that can contain fluid, gas, or other substances. They can occur anywhere in the body and may cause a lump.\n\nAbscess: An abscess is a pocket of pus that can form due to an infection. It can cause a painful lump.\n\nLipoma: A lipoma is a benign (noncancerous) growth of fat cells that can occur anywhere in the body, including the neck.\n\nIt's important to have any lump evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. They may recommend further testing, such as a biopsy or imaging tests, to help make a diagnosis.<>medicine
