Why do people buy Steam trading cards ? Especially ones you get simply from loading up the game the first time ? I now have $ 1 from selling worthless items which I obtained by accident while enjoying myself . How is this possible ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The cards you get are random , so people buy them just because they 're missing them . It 's just about collecting stuff .<>Steam trading cards are virtual cards that you can get by playing certain games on the Steam platform. Some people like to collect these cards because they are a way to show off their favorite games or because they enjoy the process of collecting them. Some people also like to trade these cards with other players to try and get cards that they don't already have. As for why people would pay money for these virtual cards, it's because some people value the cards as a way to show off their favorite games or as a way to collect something. Just like how some people collect physical trading cards, stamps, or other collectibles, some people enjoy collecting virtual items as well. In the same way that some people might be willing to pay money for a rare physical trading card, some people might be willing to pay money for a rare virtual trading card. It's also possible that some people might be willing to pay money for these virtual cards because they can be used to craft badges on Steam, which can then be displayed on a player's profile. These badges can show off a player's accomplishments or interests, and some people might see them as a way to show off their love for a particular game or as a way to connect with other players who have similar interests. Finally, it's important to remember that not all Steam trading cards are worth the same amount of money. Some cards are more common and might not be worth very much, while others are rarer and might be worth more. Just like with any collectible, the value of a Steam trading card can vary based on a variety of factors.<>reddit_eli5
