Why is it that in older movies , English and American accents so different compared to today ? Does this major change occur every century ? Why ? I 've added the link to a video from 1914 , as an example of this older accent . URL_0 Explain like I'm five.<>I had an English teacher in college who said that the American accent we have today would have not sounded out of place in 18th century London . Whether this is true , I do n't know but , the say she explained it , it sounded reasonable .<>The English and American accents that you hear in older movies are different from what you might hear today because language and accents change over time, just like other aspects of culture. Accents can change for a variety of reasons, including changes in the way people pronounce words, the influence of other languages or dialects, and changes in the social and cultural norms of a particular place.\r\n\r\nFor example, the English and American accents that you hear in the video from 1914 are different from what you might hear today because they reflect the way people spoke at that time. In the early 20th century, people pronounced some words and sounds differently than they do today, and their accents also reflected the influence of other languages and dialects that were spoken in their communities.\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep in mind that language and accents are always changing, and what sounds \"old\" or \"different\" to us today might not seem so to someone in the future.<>reddit_eli5
