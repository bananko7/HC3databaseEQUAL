Please explain what is \"Random variables\"<>A random variable (also called random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable) is a mathematical formalization of a quantity or object which depends on random events. It is a mapping or a function from possible outcomes (e.g., the possible upper sides of a flipped coin such as heads \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n and tails \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n) in a sample space (e.g., the set \n\n\n\n{\nH\n,\nT\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{H,T\\}}\n\n) to a measurable space, often the real numbers (e.g., \n\n\n\n{\nâˆ’\n1\n,\n1\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{-1,1\\}}\n\n in which 1 corresponding to \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n and -1 corresponding to \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n).\nInformally, randomness typically represents some fundamental element of chance, such as in the roll of a dice; it may also represent uncertainty, such as measurement error. However, the interpretation of probability is philosophically complicated, and even in specific cases is not always straightforward. The purely mathematical analysis of random variables is independent of such interpretational difficulties, and can be based upon a rigorous axiomatic setup.\nIn the formal mathematical language of measure theory, a random variable is defined as a measurable function from a probability measure space (called the sample space) to a measurable space. This allows consideration of the pushforward measure, which is called the distribution of the random variable; the distribution is thus a probability measure on the set of all possible values of the random variable. It is possible for two random variables to have identical distributions but to differ in significant ways; for instance, they may be independent.\nIt is common to consider the special cases of discrete random variables and absolutely continuous random variables, corresponding to whether a random variable is valued in a discrete set (such as a finite set) or in an interval of real numbers. There are other important possibilities, especially in the theory of stochastic processes, wherein it is natural to consider random sequences or random functions. Sometimes a random variable is taken to be automatically valued in the real numbers, with more general random quantities instead being called random elements.\nAccording to George Mackey, Pafnuty Chebyshev was the first person \"to think systematically in terms of random variables\".<>A random variable is a variable that can take on different values randomly. It is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment. For example, consider the random experiment of rolling a single die. The possible outcomes of this experiment are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We can define a random variable X to represent the outcome of rolling a die, such that X = 1 if the outcome is 1, X = 2 if the outcome is 2, and so on.\n\n\n\nThere are two types of random variables: discrete and continuous. A discrete random variable is one that can take on only a finite or countably infinite number of values, such as the number of heads that appear when flipping a coin three times. A continuous random variable is one that can take on any value within a certain range, such as the time it takes for a person to run a mile.\n\n\n\nProbability distributions are used to describe the possible values that a random variable can take on and the likelihood of each value occurring. For example, the probability distribution for the random variable X described above (the outcome of rolling a die) would be a uniform distribution, since each outcome is equally likely.<>wiki_csai
