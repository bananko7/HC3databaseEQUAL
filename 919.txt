Please explain what is \"Bayesian inference\"<>Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics. Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application in a wide range of activities, including science, engineering, philosophy, medicine, sport, and law. In the philosophy of decision theory, Bayesian inference is closely related to subjective probability, often called \"Bayesian probability\".<>Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes how to compute the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n\n\n\nIn Bayesian inference, the probability of a hypothesis is updated as new evidence becomes available. This is in contrast to classical (frequentist) statistical inference, in which the probability of a hypothesis is not updated based on the data, but rather is fixed and the data are used to test the hypothesis.\n\n\n\nThe key idea behind Bayesian inference is that the data and the hypothesis can be treated as random variables and that the relationship between them can be described using probability theory. This allows us to make probabilistic predictions about the hypothesis based on the data, and to update those predictions as new data becomes available.\n\n\n\nBayesian inference is often used in machine learning and data analysis, where it can be used to make predictions about complex systems based on limited data. It is also used in many other fields, including economics, psychology, and biology, to make inferences about uncertain events based on observed data.<>wiki_csai
