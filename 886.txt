Poly cystic ovary disease is becoming a common problem nowadays. It occurs due to hormonal imbalance. Usually insulin sensitizers are hormonal pills are used to treat the problem. But combined hormonal pills usually prevent the pregnancy. And also PCOD can recur. So lifestyle modifications, maintaining ideal body weight etc are important in treating PCOD. You can use the apcod sachets and other drugs recommend by your doctor. They won't prevent pregnancy and also ovashield helps in ovulation induction. Let your husband undergo seminal analysis once to rule out the male factor problem. Then you can go for follicular study and can plan intercourse around the time of ovulation. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. Take care.<>I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with PCOS and trying to conceive for so long.
