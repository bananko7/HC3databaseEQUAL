Why do some people hate the idea of marriage ? Like they are ok with long term \/ til death relationships , but no go on marriage . Is it the ceremony ? The legality of it ? Just wondering different peoples takes on it . Please explain like I'm five.<>There is probably a spectrum of reasons why some folks are not OK with marriage . I 'll try to get some of them here : Some people do n't need religious or governmental recognition of their personal relationship . Some folks tried it and had a bad experience . Would you keep eating a food that left a bad taste in your mouth ? Some folks ( like me ) see a conflict between the natural human urge for sexual diversity and monogamy ( most peoples idea of marriage ) . Some folks may have grown a child of a bad marriage and do n't want to risk that kind of situation for themselves . Some folks are happier alone . Some folks prefer not to make a life long commitment they might not be able to guarantee . Some folks are just happy being together and do n't feel a need to formalize or label the happiness . This is an incomplete list . There are things on this list that may be obviously flawed logic to some , but a realistic frame of mind for others . There are things on this list that go way deeper than an ELI5 explanation can answer . So please do n't pick it apart , but feel free to add to it for OP .<>There can be many different reasons why some people might not want to get married. Here are a few possible reasons: 1. The ceremony: Some people might not like the idea of a formal wedding ceremony and all the planning that goes into it. They might prefer to have a more low-key or informal celebration of their commitment. 2. Legalities: Some people might not like the idea of getting legally married because it involves certain legal rights and obligations, such as sharing assets and debts or making decisions about healthcare in the event of an emergency. 3. Personal beliefs: Some people might have personal or philosophical beliefs that are opposed to the concept of marriage. For example, they might believe that relationships should be based on love and commitment rather than legal contracts. 4. Past experiences: Some people might have had negative experiences with marriage in the past, either their own or those of people they know, and this might make them hesitant to get married themselves. 5. Independence: Some people might value their independence and autonomy, and they might feel that marriage would be too constricting or would require them to give up too much of their freedom. It's important to note that everyone is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. Some people might be perfectly happy in a long-term, committed relationship without ever getting married, while others might see marriage as an important step in their relationship.<>reddit_eli5
