Please explain what is \"Black swan theory\"<>The black swan theory or theory of black swan events is a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. The term is based on an ancient saying that presumed black swans did not exist –  a saying that became reinterpreted to teach a different lesson after they were discovered in Australia.\nThe theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, starting in 2001, to explain:\nTaleb's \"black swan theory\" refers only to unexpected events of large magnitude and consequence and their dominant role in history. Such events, considered extreme outliers, collectively play vastly larger roles than regular occurrences.: xxi  More technically, in the scientific monograph \"Silent Risk\", Taleb mathematically defines the black swan problem as \"stemming from the use of degenerate metaprobability\".<>The black swan theory is a concept in risk management that refers to events or occurrences that are unexpected and have a significant impact. The term is derived from the metaphor of a black swan, which refers to a hypothetical event that is unexpected and has a significant impact, but is also retrospectively explainable.\n\n\n\nThe black swan theory was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book \"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,\" in which he argues that black swan events are not only highly impactful, but also difficult to predict or anticipate. According to Taleb, black swan events are characterized by their rarity, their extreme impact, and the fact that they are often only explainable in hindsight.\n\n\n\nThe black swan theory has important implications for risk management and decision-making, as it suggests that we should be prepared for and able to adapt to unexpected and potentially catastrophic events. It also highlights the importance of being aware of our own biases and limitations when it comes to predicting and managing risk, and the need to be open to the possibility that events or outcomes that we consider unlikely or impossible may actually occur.<>wiki_csai
