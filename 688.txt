How Do You Get Hepatitis C<>HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use , poorly sterilized medical equipment and transfusions .<>Hepatitis C is a viral infection that affects the liver.

This can occur through injection drug use, where contaminated needles and syringes are shared; through blood transfusions or organ transplants with contaminated blood; and through accidental needle sticks in healthcare settings.\\n\\nHepatitis C can also be transmitted sexually, although this is less common. People who have multiple sexual partners or who have sex with someone who is infected with hepatitis C are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.\\n\\nIt is important to practice safe injection and sexual practices to reduce the risk of hepatitis C infection.
