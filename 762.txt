Where can I find accurate historical distribution data for mutual funds?<>If you want to go far upstream, you can get mutual fund NAV and dividend data from the Nasdaq Mutual Fund Quotation Service (MFQS). This isn't for end-users but rather is offered as a part of the regulatory framework. Not surprisingly, there is a fee for data access. From Nasdaq's MFQS specifications page: To promote market transparency, Nasdaq operates the Mutual Fund Quotation Service (MFQS). MFQS is designed to facilitate the collection and dissemination of daily price, dividends and capital distributions data for mutual funds, money market funds, unit investment trusts (UITs), annuities and structured products.<>There are several sources where you can find accurate historical distribution data for mutual funds. One option is to visit the website of the mutual fund company or the fund's sponsor. Many mutual fund companies make this information readily available on their websites, and it is typically presented in the form of a table or chart that shows the distribution amounts for different periods of time.Another option is to use financial data websites or databases that provide historical mutual fund data. Some examples include Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, and Bloomberg. These websites typically allow you to search for a specific mutual fund and view its distribution history. In some cases, you may need to create an account or subscribe to a service in order to access this information.Finally, you can also find mutual fund distribution data in annual or semi-annual reports that mutual fund companies are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports are available on the SEC's website (www.sec.gov) or through the EDGAR system, which is a database of publicly available company filings.<>finance
