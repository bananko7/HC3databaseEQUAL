Some possible causes of arm pain include muscle strain or injury, nerve irritation or compression, blood vessel problems, and inflammation or infection. In some cases, arm pain may be related to a problem in the neck or upper spine, or it may be a symptom of a more general health condition such as diabetes or heart disease.\n\nIt's possible that your arm pain could be related to your weight or to your exercise routine, but it's also possible that it could be due to other factors. If the pain is persistent or severe, or if it is accompanied by other symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or tingling, it's important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation. They will be able to perform a physical examination and possibly order tests to determine the cause of your arm pain and recommend appropriate treatment.<>medicine
