Could slight pain and discomfort be symptoms of hernia?I had two hernia repairs within the last 18 months - one direct and then an indirect one. Last one done four months ago. I have slight pain\/discomfort above the direct one. Not sure I feel another hernia or if I just have pain (1 on scale of 1 to 10) as a result of light workout I did a week ago.<>Hi,It seems that due to adhesion formation at the site of hernia repair might give this problem.If there is massive abdominal muscle weakness or laxity does give recurrence.If bulging and discomfort is there consult surgeon and get examined.Avoid lifting heavy weight, constipation and cough reflex.Ok and take care.<>It is possible that you could be experiencing pain or discomfort as a result of your hernia repairs. Hernias can sometimes recur after surgery, especially if the underlying cause of the hernia has not been addressed or if the patient has not taken steps to prevent further strain on the repaired area. In some cases, pain or discomfort following hernia surgery can also be due to scar tissue formation or muscle spasm.\n\nIf you are experiencing pain or discomfort following your hernia surgery, it is important to discuss this with your surgeon or primary care provider. They will be able to assess your symptoms and determine the cause of your pain. It is also important to follow your surgeon's post-operative instructions, which may include avoiding activities that put strain on the repaired area, taking pain medication as prescribed, and attending follow-up appointments.<>medicine
