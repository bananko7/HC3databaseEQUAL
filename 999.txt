Please explain what is \"Wafer (electronics)\"<>In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si), used for the fabrication of integrated circuits and, in photovoltaics, to manufacture solar cells. The wafer serves as the substrate for microelectronic devices built in and upon the wafer. It undergoes many microfabrication processes, such as doping, ion implantation, etching, thin-film deposition of various materials, and photolithographic patterning. Finally, the individual microcircuits are separated by wafer dicing and packaged as an integrated circuit.<>A wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor material, such as silicon or germanium, used in the manufacture of electronic devices. It is typically round or square in shape and is used as a substrate on which microelectronic devices, such as transistors, integrated circuits, and other electronic components, are fabricated.\n\n\n\nThe process of creating microelectronic devices on a wafer involves many steps, including photolithography, etching, and doping. Photolithography involves patterning the surface of the wafer using light-sensitive chemicals, while etching involves removing unwanted material from the surface of the wafer using chemicals or physical processes. Doping involves introducing impurities into the wafer to modify its electrical properties.\n\n\n\nWafers are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including computers, smartphones, and other consumer electronics, as well as in industrial and scientific applications. They are typically made from silicon because it is a widely available, high-quality material with good electronic properties. However, other materials, such as germanium, gallium arsenide, and silicon carbide, are also used in some applications.<>wiki_csai
