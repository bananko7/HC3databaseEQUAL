Does the rise in ACA premiums affect employer-provided health insurance premiums?<>Depends on the insurance company itself, as well as the costs of treatments. Imagine an ideal scenario where costs of treatments stayed the same, and that all insurance plans were segregated and pulled from the same pool of funds to pay for treatments. Then employer subsidized health insurance plans would be unaffected by the drama in the ACA plans. Those are the factors to consider, from my understanding. But I wouldn't be surprised if the burdens of accepting people that would previously never have been serviced by these companies has greatly distorted the market as a whole.<>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) can affect employer-provided health insurance premiums in several ways.First, the ACA requires that all insurance plans cover a set of essential health benefits, such as preventive care, prescription drugs, and mental health services. These requirements can increase the cost of insurance for employers, which may be passed on to employees in the form of higher premiums.Second, the ACA introduced a number of taxes and fees that apply to employer-provided health insurance. These fees can also increase the cost of insurance for employers and may be passed on to employees through higher premiums.Finally, the ACA created the health insurance marketplace, where individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance. The ACA's subsidies and premium tax credits, which are available to some individuals and small businesses, can make purchasing insurance through the marketplace more affordable. This may lead some employers to shift their employees to the marketplace, which could result in higher premiums for those employees.Overall, the ACA has had a complex effect on employer-provided health insurance premiums, and the impact on any particular employer or employee will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific features of their insurance plan and the subsidies and tax credits available to them.<>finance
