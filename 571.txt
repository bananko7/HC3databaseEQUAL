I can understand your concern.You have gone through ultrasound for gall bladder. Your gall bladder is normal but there is shadow at tip of pancreas. It can be pancreatic cyst or some mass in pancreas. So to diagnose the cause CT scan is required. So go for it. It can be benign lesion or can be malignant. But investigations are required. So consult your doctor and plan accordingly.Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer.Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.<>A barium CT scan is a type of imaging test that can be used to visualize the digestive system, including the pancreas. It involves swallowing a liquid that contains barium, which coats the lining of the digestive tract and makes it easier to see on the CT scan. The test can be helpful in identifying abnormalities or problems in the pancreas or other parts of the digestive system.\n\nThe fact that you have been advised to undergo a barium CT scan following an ultrasound that showed a shadow at the tip of your pancreas suggests that your doctor is concerned about this finding and wants to further evaluate it. It is important to follow your doctor's recommendations and undergo the recommended testing to determine the cause of the shadow and determine the appropriate course of treatment, if necessary. It is not possible to determine the severity of the problem without further evaluation, but it is important to address any potential concerns with your doctor.<>medicine
