What makes a liquid flammable ? Like why can you set kerosene , gasoline and alcool on fire but not milk and orange juice ? Explain like I'm five. <>It 's actually not the liquid itself that burns . It 's the mixture of their vapours and the oxygen in the air that 's flammable .<>Flammability is the ability of a substance to catch fire and burn. Some liquids are flammable because they contain molecules that are easily ignited and can burn readily. Other liquids are not flammable because they do not contain these types of molecules or because they do not evaporate easily, which is necessary for a fire to start and continue burning.\\n\\nKerosene, gasoline, and alcohol are all flammable liquids because they contain molecules that can be easily ignited and burn readily. Milk and orange juice are not flammable because they do not contain these types of molecules. Milk contains proteins and fats that do not burn easily, and orange juice is mostly water, which does not burn at all.\\n\\nIn general, liquids that are flammable have low flash points, which means they can be easily ignited and will burn at relatively low temperatures. Non-flammable liquids have higher flash points, which means they require higher temperatures to ignite and will not burn as easily.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
