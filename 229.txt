Please explain what is \"John Searle\"<>John Rogers Searle (\/sɜːrl\/; born July 31, 1932) is an American philosopher widely noted for contributions to the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy. He began teaching at UC Berkeley in 1959, and was Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley until 2019.\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Searle was secretary of \"Students against Joseph McCarthy\". He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the University of Oxford, where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 Free Speech Movement. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley's 1980 rent stabilization ordinance. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court's \"Searle Decision\" of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.\nIn 2000, Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind & Brain Prize. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2010. Searle's early work on speech acts, influenced by J.L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein, helped establish his reputation. His notable concepts include the \"Chinese room\" argument against \"strong\" artificial intelligence.\nIn June 2019, Searle's status as professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, was revoked for his repeated violations of the university's sexual harassment policies.<>John Searle is a philosopher and cognitive scientist. He is known for his contributions to the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind, and for his development of the concept of the \"Chinese room,\" which he used to argue against the possibility of strong artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\n\nSearle was born in Denver, Colorado in 1932 and received his bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his doctorate from Oxford University. He has taught at the University of California, Berkeley for much of his career and is currently the Slusser Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at that institution.\n\n\n\nSearle's work has been influential in the field of philosophy, particularly in the areas of language, mind, and consciousness. He has written extensively on the nature of intentionality, the structure of language, and the relationship between language and thought. In his famous Chinese room argument, he argued that it is impossible for a machine to have genuine understanding or consciousness, as it can only manipulate symbols and has no understanding of their meaning.\n\n\n\nSearle has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Jean Nicod Prize, the Erasmus Prize, and the National Humanities Medal. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Philosophical Society.<>wiki_csai
