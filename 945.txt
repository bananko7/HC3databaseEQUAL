How does sports drink \" Hydrate you more \" than water ? Does sports drinks like Gatorade actually hydrate you more than water like some adds claim ? If so how is this possible ? And is it a effective substitute from drinking water alltogether ? Explain like I'm five. <>They do n't hydrate you more . They do two things though . One is quick and easy calories . Second , water is n't the only thing you sweat out . There 's also salt and minerals . Losing enough of that is bad . And just drinking water does n't replenish it . Sports drinks have salts in them so that is replenish this . That 's what electrolytes are , salt . However , unless you are basically a professional athelete sports drink are not something you need . At all . You need electrolytes and easy calories if you work out ALL DAY not if you go to the gym for an hour or two .<>Sports drinks like Gatorade are designed to help replenish electrolytes and carbohydrates that are lost through sweat during exercise. Electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, help regulate the balance of fluids in your body and are important for muscle function. Carbohydrates provide energy for your muscles to use during exercise.\\n\\nWater is essential for hydration, but it does not contain electrolytes or carbohydrates. So, if you are exercising for an extended period of time and sweating a lot, a sports drink can help replenish the electrolytes and carbohydrates that your body is losing, which can help you stay hydrated and energized.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that sports drinks are not a substitute for water. Water is still the most important thing to drink to stay hydrated. Sports drinks can be used in addition to water, especially during or after intense or prolonged exercise, to help replace electrolytes and carbohydrates that have been lost through sweat.\\n\\nIn summary, sports drinks like Gatorade can help you stay hydrated by replacing electrolytes and carbohydrates that are lost through sweat during exercise. However, water is still the most important thing to drink to stay hydrated, and sports drinks should be used in addition to water, rather than as a substitute.<>reddit_eli5
