Is it legal to not get a 1099-b until March 15?<>The deadline to mail is February 15. However, if the form is being prepared by a middleman (i.e. Wells Fargo) then they have until March 15th (on page 24). Also, if you haven't received your 1099 form by February 14, you may contact the IRS and they will contact and request the missing form on your behalf. I know that's a lot of information, but to answer your question, yes, there are situations where March 15th is the deadline instead of February 15th.<>According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), brokerages and other financial firms have until February 15th to send out 1099-B forms to their customers for the previous tax year. However, if the brokerage or firm files for an extension, they are permitted to send out the forms by March 15th. If you have not received your 1099-B form by March 15th and you have not received notification that the brokerage or firm has filed for an extension, you should contact them to inquire about the status of your form. It is important to note that you are still responsible for accurately reporting your income and gains or losses on your tax return, even if you do not receive a 1099-B form. If you do not receive the form and are unable to obtain it, you should make an effort to obtain the necessary information from the brokerage or firm and report it accurately on your tax return.<>finance
