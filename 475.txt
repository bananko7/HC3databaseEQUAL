Why do we die or get sick if we have contact with certain types of material \/ metals ? Why is it possible to get sick or die just by simply touching materials without being allergic to them ? Explain like I'm five.<>Because many metals are poisonous . Mercury , for example , inhibits thioredoxin reductase , an enzyme essential to antioxidant restoration . Without antioxidants in sufficient quantities your brain has a real bad time . Elemental mercury is fairly safe to handle , but dimethyl mercury will not only penetrate most protective garments , it will also kill you in incredibly small quantities and it 'll hurt the whole time you 're dying . Chemistry is fun kids !<>\\nThere are many different ways that we can get sick or die from coming into contact with certain materials or metals. Some materials or metals can be poisonous or toxic if we ingest them or if they get into our bodies in other ways, such as through cuts or scratches on our skin. Other materials or metals can cause allergic reactions in some people, which can range from mild to severe and may include symptoms like itching, rash, difficulty breathing, and even death in severe cases.\\n\\nIt's also possible to get sick or die from coming into contact with materials or metals that carry germs or infections. For example, if we touch a surface that has been contaminated with the germs that cause a particular illness, we may become sick if we then touch our mouth, nose, or eyes before washing our hands.\\n\\nOverall, it's important to be cautious when coming into contact with materials or metals that we are not familiar with and to follow safety precautions to protect ourselves from harm.<>reddit_eli5
