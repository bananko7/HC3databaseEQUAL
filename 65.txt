Reddit ( Warning : Meta ! ) Really , how can someone explain reddit ? I 've ineffectively explained reddit time and time again to curious friends , so how do I do it ? Explain like I'm five.<>Reddit is in all simplicity a \" link site \" , which means that it is a place where people post links to other sites . There are many different variations on this concept that have existed \/ continue to exist on the internet . The difference between Reddit and many other sites is its system of delivering relevant content to the user . Content is sorted via the upvote \/ downvote button ( along with a complex algorithm that reduces the relevancy of older posts ) . If a user finds link submitted interesting , the user can essentially \" promote \" it , by hitting the upvote . If a user dislikes something , the user can downvote it . This allows users to aggregate and sort these links into a relevant list . By creating an account , you are able to subscribe to different sections of the site ( subreddits ) that contain more specific types of links . This allows for you to receive a personalized homepage of links that are relevant to you . The culture of Reddit is another question in and of itself and would require a bit more time to explain things like memes , certain subreddits , and the \" circlejerk \" effect . But this is what I use to describe the mechanics of Reddit , in a nutshell .<>Reddit is a website where people can post things and other people can comment on them or upvote them if they like them. It's kind of like a big online conversation where people talk about all sorts of things. There are lots of different communities on Reddit called \"subreddits\" where people talk about specific topics, like movies or animals or science. You can subscribe to different subreddits to see the things that people are posting and talking about in those communities.<>reddit_eli5
