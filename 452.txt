Shorting Obvious Pump and Dump Penny Stocks<>Assuming you have no non-public material information, it should be perfectly legal. I suspect it's not a great idea for the reasons that Joe outlined, but it should be legal.<>Penny stocks, also known as microcap stocks, are stocks that trade for very low prices, typically under $5 per share. They can be attractive to some investors because they can potentially offer large returns if the stock price increases significantly. However, penny stocks are also often the subject of \"pump and dump\" schemes, in which unscrupulous individuals or groups try to artificially inflate the price of the stock through false or misleading information, then sell their own holdings at a profit when the price is at its peak.Shorting penny stocks can be risky, especially if the stock is being manipulated through a pump and dump scheme. When you short a stock, you borrow shares from someone else and sell them in the market, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price and return them to the lender. If the price of the stock increases instead of decreasing, you will lose money on the trade.If you are considering shorting penny stocks, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and to do your own research to determine whether the stock is likely to increase or decrease in value. This can include researching the company's financial health, looking for news and press releases that may affect the stock price, and checking to see if there are any regulatory warnings or enforcement actions against the company or its management. It is also important to be aware of any potential signs of a pump and dump scheme, such as sudden and unexplained price spikes or unusual trading volume, and to avoid investing in stocks that may be the subject of such schemes.<>finance
