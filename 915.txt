Why do n't establishments which serve alachol all have breathalyzers so intoxicated patrons know they legally ca n't drive . Its almost midnight and I was just wondering . Explain like I'm five.<>I heard people tried that , but it did n't work so well when they found out people were using it as a drinking game seeing who could blow the highest<>Establishments that serve alcohol do not typically have breathalyzers for their patrons to use because it is not their responsibility to determine if someone is safe to drive. It is the individual's responsibility to make sure they are not drinking too much alcohol and are able to drive safely. It is also illegal to drive while under the influence of alcohol, so it is important for people to make good decisions about whether or not they should get behind the wheel. If someone has had too much to drink and is not safe to drive, it is important for them to find a safe way to get home, such as calling a taxi or ride-sharing service, or asking a sober friend for a ride.<>reddit_eli5
