How would bonds fare if interest rates rose?<>When interest rates rise, the price of bonds fall because bonds have a fixed coupon rate, and since the interest rate has risen, the bond's rate is now lower than what you can get on the market, so it's price falls because it's now less valuable. Bonds diversify your portfolio as they are considered safer than stocks and less volatile. However, they also provide less potential for gains. Although diversification is a good idea, for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs, not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis. In your case where you have mutual funds already, it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you cannot relate to. The benefit of having a mutual fund is to have a professional manage your money, and that includes diversification as well so that you don't have to do that.<>When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds tends to fall, because the market is offering higher yields on new bonds. This is because investors are willing to accept lower prices for existing bonds in order to obtain the higher yields that are being offered on new bonds.For example, if you own a bond that pays a fixed interest rate of 3% per year and the market interest rate rises to 4%, the value of your bond will decline, because investors can now earn a higher yield by buying a new bond that pays 4% per year. This decline in value can make it more difficult to sell the bond, and it may also reduce the overall return you receive from holding the bond.However, it's important to note that the relationship between interest rates and bond prices is not always straightforward. Other factors, such as the creditworthiness of the issuer and the duration of the bond, can also affect bond prices. In general, though, rising interest rates tend to be negative for bond prices.<>finance
