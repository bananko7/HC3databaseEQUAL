It is also important to pay attention to your diet and try to identify any specific foods or habits that may be causing or contributing to your abdominal pain.\n\nThere are several possible causes of upper right abdominal pain that can radiate to the back, even if the ultrasound is normal. Some possible causes include:\n\nGallbladder problems: The gallbladder is located in the upper right abdomen and can cause pain when it becomes inflamed or infected.\n\nPancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause upper abdominal pain that may radiate to the back.\n\nUlcers: Stomach or duodenal ulcers can cause abdominal pain that may be worse after eating.\n\nConstipation: Severe constipation can cause abdominal pain, especially in the upper right part of the abdomen.\n\nHernia: A hernia is a protrusion of abdominal tissue through a weak point in the abdominal wall, which can cause pain in the upper right abdomen.\n\nIf you are still experiencing abdominal pain after completing the prescribed course of medication and have not been able to identify any specific triggers or habits that may be contributing to the pain, it may be a good idea to follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and testing. They may recommend additional tests, such as blood work or a CT scan, to help determine the cause of your symptoms.<>medicine
