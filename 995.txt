Do expensive sunglasses like Oakleys actually provide better protection from the sun compared to dollar store glasses ? ... or are you just paying for the name \/ marketing ? Explain like I'm five.<>The answers here are all over the place . Yes , you are paying for name \/ marketing , but you are also paying for correctly oriented polarized lenses . There is also UV protection , but you can find that on cheap pairs too . What makes Oakleys preferable is that the polarized lenses ( which reduce glare ) are oriented in the same direction . If they are not oriented the same direction , your brain will have difficulty correcting the slight distortions , which will eventually make it uncomfortable to wear them .<>,"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
