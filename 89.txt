Please explain what is \"Edward Fredkin\"<>Edward Fredkin (born October 2, 1934) is a distinguished career professor at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and an early pioneer of digital physics.\nFredkin's primary contributions include work on reversible computing and cellular automata. While Konrad Zuse's book, Calculating Space (1969), mentioned the importance of reversible computation, the Fredkin gate represented the essential breakthrough. In recent work, he uses the term digital philosophy (DP).\nDuring his career, Fredkin has been a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at Caltech, and Research Professor of Physics at Boston University.<>Edward Fredkin is a computer scientist and digital philosopher who has made significant contributions to the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. He is best known for his work on cellular automata, which are mathematical systems that can be used to model complex systems and behaviors.\n\n\n\nFredkin received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from MIT in 1959 and his PhD in physics from the University of Maryland in 1966. He has held various academic and research positions throughout his career, including at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Carnegie Mellon University, and the Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Fredkin developed the concept of \"digital philosophy,\" which is a philosophical approach that views the universe as being fundamentally digital in nature. According to this perspective, all physical phenomena can be reduced to information and computation, and the universe can be understood as a giant computer that is running a program.\n\n\n\nFredkin has also made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of machine learning and natural language processing. He has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the ACM SIGACT Knuth Prize for his contributions to the foundations of computer science.<>wiki_csai
