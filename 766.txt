What relieves the pain in the back of the leg?I was playing football in the backyard and my dog ran up behind me and ran into the back of my leg, there was a sharp pain straight away but eased down after about 2 minutes, I got up and limped to my bedroom and lied down on my bed and the pain came back again and now the pain is almost unbearable, I can't put pressure on my foot at all now. What can I do to stop the pain?<>First, you should go to hospital to take rabies vaccine if dog bite you. You should do x- ray to exclude presence of dislocation or disc sublaxation.
