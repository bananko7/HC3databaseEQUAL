Why does popcorn pop ? The chemical reasons do n't interest me as much as from a biological and evolutionary stand - point . Why does popcorn pop under extreme heat , and under what circumstances would this occur in nature ? What purpose does it serve ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Why do people look for evolution in everything ? You are nearly as bad as people who seek to shove religion into everything . Corn pops because when you apply a bunch of heat to a kernel you boil the water inside . Since this water has nowhere to go it eventually causes the entire kernel to explode . For some reading - URL_0<>Popcorn is a type of corn that has a hard outer shell called a hull and a small amount of moisture inside. When the kernel is heated, the moisture turns to steam and builds up pressure inside the hull. Eventually, the pressure becomes too great and the hull explodes, turning the kernel inside out and creating the characteristic puff of a popped kernel. In nature, popcorn can pop when it is exposed to high heat, such as from a fire. This can happen when kernels of popcorn fall into a fire and are heated to a high temperature. The heat causes the moisture inside the kernels to turn to steam and build up pressure, eventually leading to the kernels popping. It's not clear what purpose popping serves for the popcorn plant. However, it is possible that the popping mechanism helps the plant to disperse its seeds. When the kernel pops, it may be able to scatter its seeds over a wider area, increasing the chances that the seeds will grow into new plants.<>reddit_eli5
