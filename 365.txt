The Spanish dollar was a silver coin that was widely accepted as a form of currency throughout the world, and it was also known as the \"peso\" in Spanish-speaking countries. When the United States gained independence from Great Britain, it adopted the Spanish dollar as its official currency. The symbol for the peso was \"P\" with a horizontal line through it, similar to the way the Korean won is represented with a \"W\" with a slash through it. The $ symbol was originally written as a fancy capital S with a vertical line through it, because it was meant to be a stylized version of the letter \"U\" and the letter \"S\", short for \"United States\". Over time, the symbol became simpler and more stylized, and it eventually evolved into the $ symbol that we use today.<>reddit_eli5
