Covered call and put options as separate trades<>Yes, if the call expires worthless, leaving you with stock. Then you can exercise your put when the stock goes below put strike price.<>Sure! A covered call option is a strategy in which an investor holds a long position in an asset and sells or writes call options on that same asset in order to generate income. A covered put option is similar, but the investor writes or sells put options on an asset that they own, rather than selling call options.In both cases, the investor is said to be \"covered\" because they own the underlying asset, which means they can deliver the asset to the buyer of the option if the option is exercised. This is in contrast to an uncovered or naked option, in which the investor does not own the underlying asset and would have to buy it at the market price if the option is exercised.Covered call options can be used to generate income in a neutral or bullish market, while covered put options can be used to generate income in a neutral or bearish market. Both strategies can be used to hedge against potential losses on the underlying asset, and both involve the sale of options and the potential to receive option premiums.<>finance
