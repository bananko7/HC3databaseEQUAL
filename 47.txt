Do I have to repay the First-Time Homebuyers tax credit if I refinance?<>No. As long as you live in the house for 3 years, it's yours to keep. Financing has nothing to do with that.<>The First-Time Homebuyer Credit was a tax credit available to first-time homebuyers who purchased a home between April 8, 2008 and December 31, 2009. This credit has since expired and is no longer available. If you received the credit when you purchased your home and you later refinance your mortgage, you do not have to repay the credit. However, if you sell your home before you have lived in it for at least three years, you may have to repay a portion of the credit. It's important to note that the rules for the First-Time Homebuyer Credit were complex and there may be other factors that affect your situation. If you have specific questions about the credit or your tax obligations, you should consult with a tax professional or the IRS.<>finance
