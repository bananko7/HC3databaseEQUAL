I advise you to consult a neurosurgeon for diagnosis and treatment. Thank you.<>I'm sorry to hear about your husband's symptoms. It's important that he see a doctor for proper evaluation and treatment. Hygromas, which are fluid-filled cysts, can sometimes cause symptoms like lightheadedness, but it's important to determine the exact cause of his symptoms in order to determine the most appropriate treatment. A doctor will be able to order additional tests and perform a physical examination to determine the cause of his symptoms and recommend the best course of action. In the meantime, it's important that he try to rest and avoid any activities that could exacerbate his symptoms. If his symptoms are severe or if he experiences any other concerning symptoms, he should seek medical attention right away.<>medicine
