Would bruising the 5th metatarsal require surgery?Hi my name is Andrea, last Wednesday I was standing on my desk so I could paint a quote on my wall and went for my chair and missed. Fell off and hit the side of my right foot on the metal part. I went to the doctor and he said I hurt my 5th metatarsal and I went back today because it still hurts and the doctor said I badly bruised it. Im just worried I will need surgery help!!!!<>Hi,Bruising is not a criteria of deciding requirement of surgery, surgery depends upon displacement of fracture fragments, to guide you properly about need of surgery i have to see X-ray. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Jaideep Gaver, Orthopedic Surgeon<>It is possible that you may have bruised your fifth metatarsal, which is a bone in your foot that extends from your ankle to your toes. Bruising can occur when the soft tissues (such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments) are damaged by a blow or impact. It is usually not necessary to have surgery for a bruised metatarsal, as the injury typically heals on its own over time. However, if you are experiencing severe pain or if the injury is not improving after a few days, it may be necessary to consult with a healthcare provider or specialist to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In the meantime, you can try using ice and over-the-counter pain medication, elevating your foot, and resting as much as possible to help manage the pain and promote healing.<>medicine
