A stop order won't be automatically fired in after-hours trading?<>Stop orders and stop limit orders typically do not execute during extended hours after the general market session has closed. Stop orders are market orders and market orders especially are not executed during extended hours. Although there are exceptions because a broker can say one thing and do another thing with the way order types are presented to customers vs what their programming actually does. The regulatory burden is a slap on the wrist, so you need to ask the broker what their practices are. Orders created during normal market hours do not execute in extended sessions, different orders would have to be made during the extended session. Your stop order should execute if the normal market hour price stays below your stop price. So a stop limit would actually be worse here, because a stop limit will create a limit order which may never get hit (since it is above the best bid best ask)<>That's correct. A stop order is an order to buy or sell a security when its price moves beyond a certain point. During regular trading hours, a stop order can be triggered by price fluctuations on the exchange. However, during after-hours trading, there is no exchange and therefore no official prices being quoted. As a result, stop orders cannot be triggered in after-hours trading.It's important to note that while after-hours trading is not as active as regular trading hours, it can still be a volatile time to trade. Prices may fluctuate significantly in response to news events or other developments, and there may be limited liquidity. As a result, traders should be cautious when participating in after-hours trading and consider using limit orders rather than stop orders to protect against potential price moves.<>finance
