Why do people wear \" business \" clothes to corporate jobs ? Why not just regular weekend wear ? It seems like a lot of unnecessary time and cost to buy the clothes , and then iron them each time etc Explain like I'm five.<>Professionalism . Plain and simple . This is something I struggled with in the military , why do we do so much shit that seems to be a waste of time . The answer is because it makes you * look * like you know what you 're doing . If you 're getting paid to perform a task , you should look different than the guy who shows up at Wal - Mart on a Saturday . It shows that you care and want things done the right way . It 's an extension of your work ethic . If you take the time to dress well , you 're not going to be a lazy person . Why does James Bond wear suits ? He could certainly use more mobility most of the time , but its about an attitude . Corporate jobs are n't about comfort , they 're about excelling at everything you do , and dressing in sweatpants and a hoodie ( however comfortable ) does n't lead to the \" kicking ass and taking names \" mentality .<>People wear \"business\" clothes to corporate jobs because it is a way to show respect for the workplace and the job they are doing.
