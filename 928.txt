what percentage of the human body is water<>Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that \"the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight.<>The human body is about 60% water. This percentage can vary slightly depending on a person's age, sex, and body composition. For example, men generally have a higher water content than women, and babies have a higher water content than adults. Water is essential for the proper functioning of the body and plays a role in many of the body's processes, including regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients and oxygen to cells, and removing waste products. It is important to drink enough water to stay hydrated and maintain the proper balance of water in the body.","The human body is about 60% water.

In general, men tend to have a higher water content than women, and younger people tend to have a higher water content than older people. Water is essential for the proper functioning of the human body and plays a vital role in many physiological processes. It is found in every cell, tissue, and organ in the body, and it is necessary for the regulation of body temperature, the transport of nutrients and waste products, and the maintenance of electrolyte balance.","The human body is about 60% water. This percentage can vary depending on a person's age, sex, and body composition. For example, men generally have a higher water content than women, and infants and young children have a higher water content than adults. The water content of the body is important for maintaining proper hydration and carrying out various physiological functions. Water plays a vital role in regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients and oxygen to cells, and removing waste products from the body. It is important to drink enough water to maintain proper hydration and support the body's functions.<>open_qa
