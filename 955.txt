Why was windows ' 98 so good ? I was only 8 when it came out , and did n't understand computers at all . Explain like I'm five.<>You probably do n't remember windows 3.1 .. when windows 95 came out shit was forever changed . When win98 came out , everything wrong with win95 was fixed ( for the most part ) . Better question- why was windows 95 so good ? Edit : just to wrap this question up in three simple words .. the start menu .<>Windows 98 was a popular operating system (a program that lets you use your computer) released by Microsoft in 1998. It was considered \"good\" because it was faster and more stable than its predecessor (an earlier version of the software), and it included many new features that made it easier to use. Some of these features included a new graphical user interface (a way to interact with the computer using pictures and icons instead of just text), support for new hardware (like printers and scanners), and improved networking capabilities (the ability to connect to other computers and share information). Overall, people liked using Windows 98 because it made it easier for them to do things on their computers.<>reddit_eli5
