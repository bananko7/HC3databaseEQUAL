Anxiety is a normal response to stress and can be beneficial in some situations, but chronic anxiety can interfere with daily life. There are a number of treatment options available for anxiety, including therapy, medication, and self-care strategies.\n\nIf your symptoms are severe or if you have trouble functioning because of your anxiety, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.
