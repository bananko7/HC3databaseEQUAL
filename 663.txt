what naturally occurring isotopes does cobalt have<>Naturally occurring cobalt (Co) is composed of 1 stable isotope , 59Co. 28 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 60Co with a half-life of 5.2714 years, 57Co with a half-life of 271.79 days, 56Co with a half-life of 77.27 days, and 58Co with a half-life of 70.86 days.<>Cobalt (Co) has several naturally occurring isotopes. The most abundant isotope is cobalt-59, which makes up about 88% of naturally occurring cobalt. This isotope has 27 neutrons and 32 protons in its nucleus. Other isotopes of cobalt include cobalt-60, cobalt-58, cobalt-57, cobalt-56, and cobalt-54. These isotopes have different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei, and some are radioactive. Cobalt-60, for example, is a radioactive isotope that is used in the medical field for cancer treatment and in industrial applications for the sterilization of equipment.","Cobalt has two naturally occurring isotopes: cobalt-59 and cobalt-60. Cobalt-59 is the most abundant isotope, making up about 95% of naturally occurring cobalt. It is a stable isotope with a long half-life of about 5.3 years. Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 5.27 years. It is produced naturally through the interaction of cosmic rays with stable cobalt atoms, but it is also used in certain medical and industrial applications.","Cobalt has several naturally occurring isotopes. The most abundant isotope of cobalt is cobalt-59, which makes up about 100% of naturally occurring cobalt. Other isotopes of cobalt include cobalt-60, cobalt-61, and cobalt-58. Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt with a half-life of 5.27 years. It is produced in small amounts through the natural decay of cobalt-59, but it is also produced artificially in nuclear reactors and is used in medicine and industry for radiation therapy and as a gamma ray source. Cobalt-61 is a rare isotope of cobalt that is produced through the natural decay of nickel-61. Cobalt-58 is a rare isotope of cobalt that is produced through the natural decay of nickel-58.<>open_qa
