How much is \" a few \" ? I 've heard it all my life , but nobody seems to know how much a few of anything really is . Ex : couple ; two several ; more than two Please explain like I'm five.<>one > a couple > a few > several > a bunch > a lot<>\"A few\" usually means a small number of things, generally three to seven. It's a little bit more than \"a couple,\" which usually means two things. \"Several\" is a little bit more than \"a few,\" and means more than three but not many. It's hard to give a precise number for \"a few\" or \"several\" because it can vary depending on the context and the person using the words. In general, you can use \"a few\" to mean a small number of things that is more than two but not a lot. Does that help?<>reddit_eli5
