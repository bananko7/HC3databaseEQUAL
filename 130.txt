Please explain like I'm five.<>I believe technically it 's an oligopoly , not monopoly . This video perfectly ( and hilariously ) sums up our frustrations : URL_0<>There are a few reasons why many people in the United States are unhappy with their internet service providers (ISPs) or cable providers. One reason is that many people feel that they are paying too much for their internet service. ISPs and cable providers often charge high prices for their services, and some people feel that they are not getting good value for their money. Another reason is that some ISPs and cable providers do not provide reliable service. This can include problems with slow internet speeds, frequent outages, or poor customer service. Finally, some people may be unhappy with their ISPs or cable providers because they feel that they have limited choices when it comes to selecting a provider. In some areas, there may only be one or two options for internet service, which can make it difficult for people to find a provider that meets their needs and budget. Overall, there are many reasons why people may be unhappy with their ISPs or cable providers, and it is important for these companies to work to improve their services and address the concerns of their customers.<>reddit_eli5
