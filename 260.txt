Why is passive tense considered incorrect by most English professors ? i.e. Instead of saying \" she was struck by a car \" , you should say \" the car struck her \" , when both seem correct , to me at least . Please explain like I'm five.<>I do n't consider it \" incorrect , \" but I think a writer should always have a purpose for using it . Do you want to remove the subject , as in \" mistakes were made but our company is going to be as strong as ever \" or do you want to shift around the stress , as in your example with the car ? When the passive voice is just randomly used , I generally ask my students why , rather than calling it \" incorrect . \"<>The passive tense is not considered incorrect by most English professors. It is a grammatically correct way to construct a sentence in English. However, it is often considered less desirable than the active tense because it can make sentences less direct and less clear. \nIn the active tense, the subject of the sentence is performing the action. For example, in the sentence \"The car struck her,\" the subject of the sentence is \"the car,\" and it is performing the action of striking. \nIn the passive tense, the subject of the sentence is receiving the action. For example, in the sentence \"She was struck by a car,\" the subject of the sentence is \"she,\" and she is receiving the action of being struck. \nThe passive tense can make sentences less direct and less clear because it can make it less obvious who is performing the action. It can also make sentences longer and more wordy. \nFor these reasons, many English professors and writing guides recommend using the active tense whenever possible to make your writing clearer and more concise. However, there are times when the passive tense can be useful, such as when you want to emphasize the person or thing receiving the action, or when you don't know who is performing the action.<>reddit_eli5
