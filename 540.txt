We 've accepted that we 're not finding anything but dead bodies and wreckage , but we 'd still like to know why the plane went down .<>I understand why you might feel that way, but the truth is that the search for flight MH370 is still ongoing because the authorities want to find out what happened to the plane and its passengers. Even though it is likely that the people on board have passed away, it is important to find the plane and any clues about what happened in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.
