How to use a stop and limit order together?<>You need to use one of each, so a single order wouldn't cover this:  The stop-loss order could be placed to handle triggering a sell market order if the stock trades at $95 or lower.  If you want, you could use a stop-limit order if you have an exit price in mind should the stock price drop to $95 though that requires setting a price for the stop to execute and then another price for the sell order to execute. The limit sell order could be placed to handle triggering a sell if the stock rises above $105. On the bright side, once either is done the other could be canceled as it isn't applicable anymore.<>A stop order is an order to buy or sell a security when its price moves past a certain point, and a limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. You can use a stop order to set a target price for your trade, and a limit order to ensure that you get the best price.For example, you might use a stop order to sell a stock if its price falls below a certain level, and a limit order to ensure that you get the best possible price for the stock. If you want to buy a stock, you could use a stop order to trigger a purchase if the stock's price rises above a certain level, and a limit order to ensure that you don't pay more than a certain price for the stock.To use a stop and limit order together, you would enter both orders with your broker. The stop order will be triggered when the stock's price moves past the specified stop price, and the limit order will then come into effect, ensuring that you buy or sell the stock at the best possible price.<>finance
