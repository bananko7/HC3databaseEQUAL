Please explain what is \"AlphaFold 2\"<>AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which performs predictions of protein structure. The program is designed as a deep learning system.\nAlphaFold AI software has had two major versions. A team of researchers that used AlphaFold 1 (2018) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) in December 2018. The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. \nA team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020. The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group. It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's global distance test (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.\nAlphaFold 2's results at CASP were described as \"astounding\" and \"transformational.\" Some researchers noted that the accuracy is not high enough for a third of its predictions, and that it does not reveal the mechanism or rules of protein folding for the protein folding problem to be considered solved. Nevertheless, there has been widespread respect for the technical achievement.\nOn 15 July 2021 the AlphaFold 2 paper was published at Nature as an advance access publication alongside open source software and a searchable database of species proteomes.[10][11][12]<>AlphaFold 2 is a machine learning system developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. It is designed to predict the 3D structure of proteins, which are important biological molecules that perform a wide range of functions in the body. Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids that fold into specific 3D structures, and their function depends on this structure. Determining the 3D structure of a protein is a challenging problem that has important implications for understanding how proteins work and for developing new drugs.\n\n\n\nAlphaFold 2 uses a combination of machine learning and physical modeling to predict protein structures. It was developed using a dataset of known protein structures, and it uses this information to learn patterns that can be used to predict the structure of a protein from its sequence of amino acids. AlphaFold 2 has achieved impressive results on a benchmark dataset of protein structures, and it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of proteins and their functions.<>wiki_csai
