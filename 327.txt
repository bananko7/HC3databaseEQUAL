When is it worth it to buy dividend-bearing stocks?<>You should never invest in a stock just for the dividend. Dividends are not guaranteed. I have seen some companies that are paying close to 10% dividends but are losing money and have to borrow funds just to maintain the dividends. How long can these companies continue paying dividends at this rate or at all. Would you keep investing in a stock paying 10% dividends per year where the share price is falling 20% per year? I know I wouldn't. Some high dividend paying stocks also tend to grow a lot slower than lower or non dividend paying stocks. You should look at the total return - both dividend yield and capital return combined to make a better decision. You should also never stay in a stock which is falling drastically just because it pays a dividend. I would never stay in a stock that falls 20%, 30%, 50% or more just because I am getting a 5% dividend. Regarding taxation, some countries may have special taxation rules when it comes to dividends just like they may have special taxation rules for longer term capital gains compared to shorter term capital gains. Again no one should use taxation as the main purpose to make an investment decision. You should factor taxation into your decision but it should never be the determining factor of your decisions. No one has ever become poor in making a gain and paying some tax, but many people have lost a great portion of their capital by not selling a stock when it has lost 50% or more of its value.<>Dividend-bearing stocks can be a good investment for investors who are looking for a source of regular income in addition to potential capital appreciation. These stocks are issued by companies that pay a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.There are a few factors to consider when deciding whether or not to invest in dividend-bearing stocks:Your investment goals: If you are looking for a steady stream of income, dividend-bearing stocks may be a good option. However, if you are mainly focused on capital appreciation, you may want to consider other types of investments.The company's financial health: It is important to research the company's financial health before investing in its stock. A company that is financially stable and has a history of consistently paying dividends is more likely to continue doing so in the future.Your tax bracket: Dividends are taxed as ordinary income, so if you are in a high tax bracket, you may want to consider other types of investments that offer tax benefits, such as tax-free municipal bonds.Your risk tolerance: Dividend-bearing stocks tend to be less volatile than stocks that do not pay dividends, as the steady stream of income can provide some downside protection. However, the value of your investment may still fluctuate based on market conditions and the company's performance.Overall, it is worth considering dividend-bearing stocks if you are looking for a source of income, have a long-term investment horizon, and are comfortable with a moderate level of risk. As with any investment, it is important to diversify your portfolio and do thorough research before making a decision.<>finance
