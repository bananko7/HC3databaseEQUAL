Are there any U.S. documents that are so top - secret that the president does n't even know about them ? Not sure if this is where I should post this question but I thought it was a good one Explain like I'm five.<>If the president did n't know about them , how would we know about them ? How would we know if any even exist if they are of that level of secrecy ?<>It is possible that there may be some highly classified documents that are only made available to a very small number of individuals within the U.S. government, and that the President may not have access to them. However, the President is typically the highest-ranking official in the U.S. government, and as such, has access to a great deal of sensitive and classified information. It is also worth noting that the President has the authority to classify or de-classify information, so it is unlikely that there would be any documents that the President is not aware of and does not have the ability to access.<>reddit_eli5
