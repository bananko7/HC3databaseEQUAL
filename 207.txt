Can I fully deduct capital losses against discounted capital gains?<>The short answer is no - the CGT discount is only applied against your net capital gain. So your net capital gain would be: $25,000 - $5,000 = $20,000 Your CGT discount is $10,000 You will then pay CGT on $10,000 Of course you could sell ABC in this financial year and sell DEF next financial year.  If you had no other share activities next financial year than that net capital loss can be carried forward to a future year. In that case your net capital gain this year would be $25,000 Your CGT discount is $12,500 You will then pay CGT on $12,500 Next year if oyu sell DEF, you'll have a $5000 net capital loss which you can carry forward to a future year as an offset against capital gains.

In general, you can use capital losses to offset capital gains of the same type, either short-term or long-term. If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, you may be able to use the excess losses to offset other types of income, up to certain limits.Short-term capital gains are gains on assets that you have held for a year or less, and long-term capital gains are gains on assets that you have held for more than one year. You can use short-term losses to offset short-term gains, and long-term losses to offset long-term gains.If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, you may be able to use the excess losses to offset other types of income, such as wages or interest income. However, there are limits on the amount of losses you can claim in this way. The excess loss rules allow you to claim up to $3,000 of excess capital losses per year against other income, with any remaining excess losses carried forward to future tax years.It's important to keep in mind that the rules for deducting capital losses can be complex, and you may want to consult with a tax professional for advice on your specific situation.<>finance
