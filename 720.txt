Why it is easier to play guitar with left hand It seems backwards that most peoples leading hand ( right ) has the repetitive , strumming job , while their secondary hand ( left ) has the job of changing shape and moving up and down the neck . Explain like I'm five.<>There is a lot of subtle control you have over the tone that is provided by the picking hand , if you are n't just strumming . You ca n't do that much with the fretting hand apart from wiggle it , hammer - on , or bend the string , and all those are difficult unless you are playing a single notes .<>It's actually not necessarily easier to play guitar with the left hand. It's just that some people find it more comfortable to play with their left hand on the neck of the guitar, while others prefer to play with their right hand. This is because everyone's body is different, and what feels comfortable and natural to one person may not feel the same way to another.\r\n\r\nThe way a guitar is typically played is with the right hand doing the strumming or picking, and the left hand pressing down on the strings to change the pitch. This is because the left hand typically has more fine motor control and is better at making precise movements, while the right hand is generally stronger and better at making quick, repetitive movements.\r\n\r\nSo, it's not that one hand is easier to use than the other, it's just that people naturally gravitate towards using the hand that feels most comfortable and natural for them. Some people find it easier to play with their left hand on the neck of the guitar because it feels more comfortable to them, while others find it easier to play with their right hand because it feels more natural.<>reddit_eli5
