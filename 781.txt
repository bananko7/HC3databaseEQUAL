Suggest remedy for seizures due to stressMy daughter is 27 years old and has had 10 seizures since March 2014. Testing has been done, no physical reason for the seizures. However, she has been experiencing acute stress and anxiety which I think is causing the seizures. She has been prescribed Keppra and I would like to know if she can add Theanine to help her with lower her stress level. Will Theanine interact with Keppra?<>Hi.I understand your concern.EEG and MRI can help for confirmative diagnosis.Stress can worsen seizure and can be treated with anti convulsant  with anxiolytic.Keppra can help to control seizure. Anxiolytic like lorazepam can help in both convulsion and stress.Thiamine is vitamin and it can help to supplement.It can not help in stress and convulsion and can be given with keppra.No need to worry.Take advise from your treating doctor.I hope I have answered your question.Thank you.<>It's important to note that Theanine is an amino acid found in tea leaves and is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of seizures or any medical condition. While it is commonly used as a supplement for stress and anxiety, there is limited scientific evidence to support its effectiveness for these purposes. Additionally, there is no published data on the interaction between Theanine and Keppra (levetiracetam), so it is not clear whether it is safe or advisable for your daughter to take Theanine while taking Keppra.\n\nIf your daughter's seizures are being caused by stress and anxiety, it is important to address these issues in order to reduce the risk of seizures. Some strategies that may be helpful include:\n\nSeeking treatment for stress and anxiety: This may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. A mental health professional can help your daughter identify the causes of her stress and anxiety and develop strategies to manage them.\n\nPracticing stress-reduction techniques: There are many techniques that can help reduce stress, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation. Encourage your daughter to try a few different techniques and find what works best for her.\n\nMaking lifestyle changes: Making healthy lifestyle changes, such as exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and getting enough sleep, can also help reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nSeeking support: Encourage your daughter to talk to friends and family about her feelings and to seek support from loved ones. It can also be helpful for her to connect with others who are dealing with similar issues through support groups or online communities.\n\nIt is important to continue working with your daughter's healthcare team to manage her seizures and find the most appropriate treatment. If you have concerns about Theanine or any other supplement, be sure to discuss them with her healthcare provider.<>medicine
