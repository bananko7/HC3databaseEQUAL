Please explain what is \"Sample complexity\"<>The sample complexity of a machine learning algorithm represents the number of training-samples that it needs in order to successfully learn a target function.\nMore precisely, the sample complexity is the number of training-samples that we need to supply to the algorithm, so that the function returned by the algorithm is within an arbitrarily small error of the best possible function, with probability arbitrarily close to 1.\nThere are two variants of sample complexity:\nThe No free lunch theorem, discussed below, proves that, in general, the strong sample complexity is infinite, i.e. that there is no algorithm that can learn the globally-optimal target function using a finite number of training samples.\nHowever, if we are only interested in a particular class of target functions (e.g, only linear functions) then the sample complexity is finite, and it depends linearly on the VC dimension on the class of target functions.<>Sample complexity refers to the number of training examples or samples that a machine learning algorithm requires in order to be able to accurately learn a task or make accurate predictions. It is a measure of how much data the algorithm needs in order to achieve a certain level of performance.\n\n\n\nIn general, the more complex the task or the more noise or variability in the data, the more samples the algorithm will need in order to learn the task accurately. Conversely, if the task is simple or the data is very clean and well-organized, the algorithm may require fewer samples in order to learn the task.\n\n\n\nSample complexity is an important consideration when designing and implementing machine learning algorithms, as it can have a significant impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. For example, an algorithm with low sample complexity may be able to learn a task quickly and accurately with a small amount of data, while an algorithm with high sample complexity may require a large amount of data and may take longer to learn the task.<>wiki_csai
