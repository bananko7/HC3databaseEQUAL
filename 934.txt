Please explain what is \"O level\"<>The O-Level (Ordinary Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred as part of the General Certificate of Education. It was introduced in place of the School Certificate in 1951 as part of an educational reform alongside the more in-depth and academically rigorous A-Level (Advanced Level) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those three jurisdictions replaced O-Level gradually with General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) completely by 1988 and, the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) over time. The Scottish equivalent was the O-grade (replaced by the Standard Grade).\nThe AO-Level (Alternative Ordinary Level) was formerly available in most subject areas. Sometimes incorrectly known as the Advanced Ordinary Level, the AO Level syllabus and examination both assumed a higher degree of maturity on the part of candidates, and employed teaching methods more commonly associated with A-Level study. The AO Level was discontinued, with final qualifications awarded in 1988.\nThe O-Level qualification is still awarded by CIE Cambridge International Examinations, the international counterpart of the British examination Board OCR (Oxford, Cambridge & Royal Society of Arts), in select locations, instead of or alongside the International General Certificate of Secondary Education qualifications. Both CIE and OCR have Cambridge Assessment as their parent organisation. The Cambridge O-Level has already been phased out and is no longer available in certain administrative regions.<>\"O level\" refers to the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level, which is a qualification that was formerly offered in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The GCE O Level was a subject-based qualification, typically taken by students in the age range of 14 to 16, and was equivalent to the Standard Grade or Intermediate examinations in Scotland, and to the Junior Certificate in Ireland. The GCE O Level was replaced by the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) in 1988, which is now offered by the University of Cambridge International Examinations.<>wiki_csai
