How do Insurance companies make money ? It seems like the point of insurance ( from the customer 's standpoint ) is to pay less money than you ' get ' . How do they even break even , much less turn a profit ? Explain like I'm five.<>Because for every person that gets paid out , there are a number who never need to get paid out . Therein lies the ability to break even and also make a profit .<>Insurance companies make money by collecting premiums from their customers. A premium is the amount of money that a person pays to an insurance company for coverage. Insurance companies use the premiums they collect to pay for the claims that their customers make. For example, if you have car insurance and you get into an accident, you would file a claim with your insurance company to get money to pay for the damages to your car. The insurance company would then use some of the premiums it has collected from you and other customers to pay for your claim. Insurance companies also make money by investing the premiums they collect. They can invest the money in things like stocks, bonds, and other financial products, and they can make a profit if the value of these investments goes up. Overall, the goal of an insurance company is to collect more in premiums than it pays out in claims and expenses, so that it can turn a profit. If the company pays out more in claims than it collects in premiums, it will lose money.<>reddit_eli5
