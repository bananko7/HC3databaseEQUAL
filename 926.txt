A hard lump is growing on my head and my memory is becoming short since the lump startedI have a friend that concerned me about a hard lump growing on his head that he said isn t painful, but keeps growing in size and its been there for the past year. What could this be? He also mentioned he feels like his memory is becoming short since the lump started?<>Hi,This is most likely to be a sebaceous cyst. This is not a serious condition. The cyst may continue to grow in which case it can be removed by minor surgery. The memory changes will be coincidental and not related to the lump.Regards,MBChB  FRCA<>It is not possible for me to diagnose a medical condition based on the information you have provided. If you are concerned about the lump on your head or your memory, it is important to speak with a medical professional. They will be able to examine you, ask you additional questions, and determine the cause of the lump and any potential impact on your memory. It is always best to consult with a doctor if you have any concerns about your health.<>medicine
