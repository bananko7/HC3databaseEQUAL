Please explain what is \"Data warehouse\"<>In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence. DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.\nThe data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the DW for reporting.\nExtract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) are the two main approaches used to build a data warehouse system.<>A data warehouse is a central repository of data that is used for reporting and data analysis. It is designed to support the efficient querying and analysis of data by end users and analysts.\n\n\n\nA data warehouse typically stores data from a variety of sources, including transactional databases, log files, and other operational systems. The data is extracted from these sources, transformed and cleaned to fit the data warehouse's schema, and then loaded into the data warehouse for reporting and analysis.\n\n\n\nData warehouses are designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, so that they can handle the large amounts of data and concurrent users that are common in business and analytical applications. They also support the use of specialized analytical tools and techniques, such as OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and data mining, which allow users to explore and analyze data in new and powerful ways.\n\n\n\nOverall, data warehouses are an important tool for businesses, organizations, and analysts, as they allow them to gain insights and make informed decisions based on data.<>wiki_csai
