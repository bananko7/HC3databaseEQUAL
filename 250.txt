How does the Mayan calendar work ? If the mayan calendar is n't a 365 day calendar why is it regarded to be so accurate to todays solar calendars ? Explain like I'm five.<>The confusion relates to the fact that Mayans had multiple calendar systems . The Tzolk'in system works on a 240 - day count and does not seem to follow any astronomical cycle . The Haab ' system works on a 365 day count that closely approximates the solar year . The systems are combined to form a Calendar Round that lasts about 52 years . For periods longer than that , the long count calendar was used . Each cycle on the long count calendar lasts about 394 years . The last cycle ended on December 21 , 2012 .<>The Mayan calendar was a system of calendars and almanacs used by the Maya civilization of ancient Mesoamerica to track time. The Maya calendar was based on a system of cycles, which were used to track time and to mark important events.\r\n\r\nThe Mayan calendar was made up of several different cycles, including the solar cycle, the lunar cycle, and the ceremonial cycle. Each of these cycles was based on different astronomical phenomena, such as the movement of the sun, the phases of the moon, and the appearance of certain stars and planets.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important cycles in the Mayan calendar was the solar cycle, which was based on the movement of the sun. The solar cycle was divided into two main parts: the haab, which was a 365-day solar year, and the tzolkin, which was a 260-day sacred year.\r\n\r\nThe Mayan calendar was very accurate and was used to predict eclipses and other astronomical events. It was also used to keep track of important events in the lives of the Maya, such as birthdays, weddings, and religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nDespite being based on different cycles, the Mayan calendar was able to accurately track time and predict astronomical events, just like our modern solar calendars do today.<>reddit_eli5
