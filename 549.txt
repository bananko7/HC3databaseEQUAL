Please explain what is \"Language modeling\"<>A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given any sequence of words of length m, a language model assigns a probability \n\n\n\nP\n(\n\nw\n\n1\n\n\n,\n…\n,\n\nw\n\nm\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P(w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{m})}\n\n to the whole sequence. Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages. Given that languages can be used to express an infinite variety of valid sentences (the property of digital infinity), language modeling faces the problem of assigning non-zero probabilities to linguistically valid sequences that may never be encountered in the training data. Several modelling approaches have been designed to surmount this problem, such as applying the Markov assumption or using neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks or transformers.\nLanguage models are useful for a variety of problems in computational linguistics; from initial applications in speech recognition to ensure nonsensical (i.e. low-probability) word sequences are not predicted, to wider use in machine translation (e.g. scoring candidate translations), natural language generation (generating more human-like text), part-of-speech tagging, parsing, Optical Character Recognition, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, information retrieval, and other applications.\nLanguage models are used in information retrieval in the query likelihood model. There, a separate language model is associated with each document in a collection. Documents are ranked based on the probability of the query Q in the document's language model \n\n\n\n\nM\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M_{d}}\n\n: \n\n\n\nP\n(\nQ\n∣\n\nM\n\nd\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P(Q\\mid M_{d})}\n\n. Commonly, the unigram language model is used for this purpose.<>Language modeling is the task of predicting the next word in a sequence given the previous words. It is a core task in natural language processing (NLP) that is used in a variety of applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation, and chatbot development.\n\n\n\nIn language modeling, a statistical model is trained on a large dataset of text, such as a collection of books or articles. The model learns the statistical patterns and relationships between words and word sequences in the text. Once trained, the model can generate new text that is similar in style and content to the training data. It can also be used to assign probabilities to sequences of words, which can be used to evaluate the likelihood of a given sequence of words occurring in the language.\n\n\n\nThere are several approaches to language modeling, including n-gram models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers. N-gram models predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous n-1 words, where n is a parameter of the model. RNNs and transformers, on the other hand, can consider the entire context of a sequence of words when making a prediction.<>wiki_csai
