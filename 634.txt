Please explain what is \"Truth function\"<>In logic, a truth function is a function that accepts truth values as input and produces a unique truth value as output. In other words: The input and output of a truth function are all truth values; a truth function will always output exactly one truth value; and inputting the same truth value(s) will always output the same truth value. The typical example is in propositional logic, wherein a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected by logical connectives; if the truth value of the compound statement is entirely determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a truth function, and any logical connectives used are said to be truth functional.\nClassical propositional logic is a truth-functional logic, in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent truth table), thus every compound statement is a truth function. On the other hand, modal logic is non-truth-functional.<>A truth function, also known as a Boolean function, is a function in logic that takes in a number of input values and outputs a single true or false value. This output value is determined based on the truth or falsity of the input values according to the rules of propositional logic.\n\n\n\nTruth functions are often used to represent logical statements, such as \"if it is raining, then the grass is wet\" or \"either the sky is blue or the grass is green.\" These statements can be represented using truth functions by assigning truth values to the variables involved (e.g., \"raining\" is true, \"grass is wet\" is true) and applying the appropriate logical connectives (e.g., \"if-then,\" \"or\").\n\n\n\nThere are several common truth functions in propositional logic, including:\n\n\n\nAND: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if both inputs are true, and false otherwise.\n\nOR: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if at least one of the inputs is true, and false otherwise.\n\nNOT: This function takes in a single input value and outputs the opposite value (e.g., true becomes false, and false becomes true).\n\nIF-THEN: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if the first input (the \"if\" part) is false or the second input (the \"then\" part) is true, and false otherwise.\n\nTruth functions are a fundamental concept in logic and are used in many different areas of computer science and mathematics, including computer programming, automated reasoning, and artificial intelligence.<>wiki_csai
