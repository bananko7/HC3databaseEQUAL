what percent of illegal immigrants are from mexico and europe<>According to a 2005 Pew Hispanic Center report, 56% of undocumented immigrants were from Mexico ; 22% were from other Latin American countries; 13% were from Asia; 6% were from Europe and Canada; and 3% were from Africa and the rest of the world.<>It is difficult to accurately estimate the percentage of illegal immigrants in the United States who come from Mexico and Europe, as illegal immigration is a covert and often unregulated activity. However, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security, the majority of illegal immigrants in the United States come from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, with Mexico being the country of origin for the largest number of illegal immigrants. A smaller number of illegal immigrants come from other regions, including Europe and Asia.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that the term \"illegal immigrant\" is sometimes used to refer to people who are living in a country without the necessary documentation or authorization, regardless of how they entered the country. Some people may enter a country illegally, while others may come to a country legally and then overstay their visas or otherwise violate the terms of their admission. The term \"undocumented immigrant\" is often used as a more neutral and accurate description for people who are living in a country without the necessary documentation.","It is difficult to accurately estimate the percentage of illegal immigrants in the United States who are from Mexico or Europe, as the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country is not officially recorded and the data that is available can be inconsistent and unreliable.\\n\\nHowever, according to the Pew Research Center, in 2019, an estimated 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States. Of these, an estimated 6.9 million (66%) were from Mexico, Central America, and South America, while an estimated 3.6 million (34%) were from other regions, including Europe. It is worth noting that these estimates are based on data from 2019 and may not reflect more recent trends in immigration patterns.","It is difficult to accurately determine the percentage of illegal immigrants in the United States who are from Mexico and Europe, as the number of illegal immigrants in the country is not accurately known. However, it is generally believed that the majority of illegal immigrants in the United States are from Latin America, with Mexico being the primary country of origin. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in 2020, the majority of unauthorized immigrants living in the United States were from Mexico (52%), El Salvador (8%), Guatemala (8%), and Honduras (5%).\\n\\nIt is also important to note that the term \"illegal immigrant\" is often used to refer to individuals who are present in the United States without proper documentation, regardless of how they entered the country. This includes individuals who may have entered the United States legally on a temporary visa, but have remained in the country beyond the expiration of their visa. It is also possible for individuals from Europe and other regions to be present in the United States illegally, although the percentage of illegal immigrants from these regions is likely to be relatively small compared to the overall number of illegal immigrants in the country.<>open_qa
