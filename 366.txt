Mixing different supplements or medications can potentially lead to harmful interactions or unintended side effects.\n\nFollihair and Revital are both dietary supplements that contain a variety of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. It is important to be aware of the potential for overlap in the ingredients of these supplements and to consider the total daily intake of these nutrients from all sources, including food, other supplements, and medications.\n\nBefore taking any supplement or medication, it is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider to ensure that it is appropriate for you and to discuss any potential risks or interactions. Your healthcare provider will be able to advise you on the safe and appropriate use of these products based on your specific needs and medical history.<>medicine
