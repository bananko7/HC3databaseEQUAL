Tickling Why are some people incredibly ticklish while others are not at all ? Why is the response almost always laughter , even when you hate it and want it to stop ? Explain like I'm five.<>Tickling evolved as a defense mechanism over the course of human evolution . Notice that the areas where you are most ticklish are where your body is most vulnerable to attack . ( Neck , sides , below ribcage , groin , etc . ) When tickled you automatically respond in a way that forces you to swipe whoever is touching you away from the area . In response to mr612 , you can not tickle yourself because you are conscious of what you are doing to yourself and do not perceive yourself as a threat .

Some people are more sensitive to tickling than others, which means that they feel the sensation more strongly and are more likely to laugh when they are tickled. This is because tickling activates a part of the brain called the \"ticklish spot,\" which is responsible for the feeling of tickling and the response of laughter.\n\nLaughter is often the response to tickling because it is a natural way for the body to communicate that it is feeling good and having fun. Even if you hate being tickled and want it to stop, your body may still react by laughing because it is programmed to do so.\n\nIt is not completely understood why some people are more ticklish than others, but it is thought that it may be related to how sensitive a person's skin is and how much they enjoy being touched. Some people may also be more ticklish because they are more sensitive to surprise or because they have a strong sense of touch.<>reddit_eli5
