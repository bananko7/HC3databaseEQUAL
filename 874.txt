Please explain what is \"Thermographic camera\"<>A thermographic camera (also called an infrared camera or thermal imaging camera, thermal camera or thermal imager) is a device that creates an image using infrared (IR) radiation, similar to a normal camera that forms an image using visible light. Instead of the 400–700 nanometre (nm) range of the visible light camera, infrared cameras are sensitive to wavelengths from about 1,000 nm (1 micrometre or μm) to about 14,000 nm (14 μm). The practice of capturing and analyzing the data they provide is called thermography.<>A thermographic camera, also known as a thermal imaging camera, is a device that uses infrared technology to create a visual image of the heat patterns emitted by an object or area. These cameras can detect and measure the temperature of objects and surfaces without the need for physical contact. They are often used in a variety of applications, including building insulation inspections, electrical inspections, and medical imaging, as well as in military, law enforcement, and search and rescue operations.\n\n\n\nThermographic cameras work by detecting and measuring the infrared radiation, or heat, emitted by objects and surfaces. This radiation is invisible to the naked eye, but it can be detected by specialized sensors and converted into a visual image that shows the temperature of different objects and surfaces. The camera then displays this information as a heat map, with different colors indicating different temperatures.\n\n\n\nThermographic cameras are highly sensitive and can detect small differences in temperature, making them useful for a variety of applications. They are often used to detect and diagnose problems in electrical systems, identify energy loss in buildings, and detect overheating equipment. They can also be used to detect the presence of people or animals in low light or obscured visibility conditions, such as during search and rescue operations or military surveillance.\n\n\n\nThermographic cameras are also used in medical imaging, particularly in the detection of breast cancer. They can be used to create thermal images of the breast, which can help to identify abnormalities that may be indicative of cancer. In this application, thermographic cameras are used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools, such as mammography, to improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis.<>wiki_csai
