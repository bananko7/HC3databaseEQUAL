The arguments against GMO 's Why is it a bad thing if we can make growing crops easier and more efficient ? I do n't understand how it 's not praised as a miracle of science Explain like I'm five.<>Diet in America has been going through fads in the past decades . The argument against GMOs is as much social and emotional as it is scientific . Most people do n't read scientific journals , so their understanding of the issue comes from less objective or reliable sources .<>Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are plants or animals that have had their DNA changed in a way that does not occur naturally. This can be done to give the organism a desired trait, such as being able to resist pests or tolerate herbicides.\r\n\r\nThere are a few main arguments against GMOs:\r\n\r\nSafety: Some people are concerned that GMOs may have unintended effects on human health or the environment. While some studies have suggested that GMOs are safe to eat and do not have negative environmental impacts, other studies have raised concerns. The long-term effects of GMOs are not yet fully understood, so more research is needed to determine their safety.\r\n\r\nControl of seeds: Many GMOs are owned by large seed companies, which can control the seeds that farmers use to grow their crops. This can lead to higher seed prices and a lack of choice for farmers.\r\n\r\nLoss of biodiversity: The use of GMOs can lead to the loss of traditional crop varieties, which can reduce the overall genetic diversity of our food supply. This can be a problem because a diverse food supply is more resilient to pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nEthical concerns: Some people believe that it is not ethical to alter the genetic makeup of plants and animals, as it goes against the natural order of things.\r\n\r\nOverall, the debate over GMOs is complex and there are valid arguments on both sides. While GMOs have the potential to make growing crops easier and more efficient, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before widespread adoption.<>reddit_eli5
