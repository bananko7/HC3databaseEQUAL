when does air bag deploy<>It is an occupant restraint system consisting of a flexible fabric envelope or cushion designed to inflate rapidly during an automobile collision .<>Airbags are designed to deploy in a collision or impact that meets certain threshold levels of force. The exact level of force required to trigger an airbag deployment can vary depending on the specific system and the type of sensor used.\\n\\nGenerally, airbags are designed to deploy in a front-end collision when the vehicle decelerates rapidly, such as in a crash or during a sudden stop. The deployment of the airbags is intended to provide additional protection for the vehicle's occupants by helping to cushion and absorb some of the impact energy.\\n\\nIt's important to note that airbags are not designed to deploy in every collision or impact, and there are certain situations in which they may not deploy even if the vehicle experiences a significant impact. For example, airbags may not deploy if the collision is a low-speed impact or if the vehicle is involved in a rollover accident.","Airbags are designed to deploy in a collision that meets certain criteria, such as a certain amount of deceleration or a certain impact force. The specific criteria for deployment can vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle and the specific airbag system it is equipped with.\\n\\nIn general, airbags are designed to deploy in frontal and near-frontal collisions, as well as some side collisions and rollovers. When the vehicle's sensors detect a collision that meets the criteria for deployment, an electrical signal is sent to the airbag inflator, which causes a chemical reaction that rapidly generates a large volume of gas. This gas inflates the airbag, which is stored in a compact form within the steering wheel or dashboard. The airbag then deploys and inflates rapidly to cushion the impact and help protect the occupants of the vehicle.\\n\\nIt is important to note that airbags are not designed to deploy in all types of collisions, and deploying an airbag does not necessarily mean that the occupants of the vehicle will be protected from all injuries. Airbags are one element of a vehicle's overall safety system and are intended to work in conjunction with seat belts, which should always be worn, and other safety features such as crumple zones and rollover protection.","Airbags are designed to deploy in a collision that meets certain criteria, such as a certain level of impact force or deceleration. The exact criteria for deployment can vary depending on the specific vehicle and airbag system. In general, airbags are designed to deploy in frontal and near-frontal collisions, as well as in rollover accidents. They are typically not designed to deploy in rear-end collisions or minor impacts.\\n\\nAirbags are typically deployed by sensors that are located throughout the vehicle and are triggered by the force of the collision. The sensors send a signal to the airbag control module, which then activates the airbags. The airbags are inflated by a chemical reaction that occurs when the control module sends an electrical current to a cartridge of compressed gas. The gas rapidly inflates the airbag, which helps to cushion the occupant and reduce the risk of injury.\\n\\nIt's important to note that airbags are designed to supplement seat belts, not to replace them. Seat belts are the primary restraint system in a vehicle and should always be worn when driving or riding in a vehicle.<>open_qa
