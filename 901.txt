Your thoughts?<>Hello. I have been throughyour question and understand  your concern.I think you should proceed with an electromyogram and nerve conductiin studies of your wife's affected extremities. These tests will help on understanding the situation. Talk to your GP about this.Hope this helps.Best regards<>There could be several potential causes for sudden numbness and weakness in the arms and legs. Some possible causes include:\n\nStroke: A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted. This can cause numbness and weakness in the arms and legs, as well as other symptoms such as difficulty speaking, trouble seeing, and a sudden severe headache.\n\nPinched nerve: A pinched nerve can cause numbness and weakness in the affected area. This can be caused by a herniated disc in the spine or other structural issues in the spine.\n\nTransient ischemic attack (TIA): Also known as a \"mini-stroke,\" a TIA is a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. It can cause symptoms similar to a stroke, but they usually resolve within 24 hours.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS): MS is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system. It can cause numbness and weakness in the arms and legs, as well as other symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty with balance and coordination, and problems with vision.\n\nGuillain-Barr√© syndrome: This is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves. It can cause weakness and numbness in the arms and legs, as well as other symptoms such as difficulty speaking and swallowing, and problems with bladder and bowel control.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy: This is a condition that affects the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. It can cause numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arms and legs.\n\nIt's important for your wife to see a doctor as soon as possible to determine the cause of her symptoms and receive appropriate treatment. In addition to the tests that have already been done, the doctor may recommend other tests such as an electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or nerve conduction studies to help diagnose the cause of the numbness and weakness.<>medicine
