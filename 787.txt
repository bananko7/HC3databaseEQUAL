Why is a home loan (mortgage) cheaper than gold loan?<>Why is a home loan (mortgage) cheaper than gold loan? It has to do with risk. Lending money secured by gold is inherently riskier than a loan secure by your home. Increased risk means the lender must charge more. That's why home loans are cheap compared to loans for other purposes. Home loans are secured by the house. Houses are assets that hold and usually retain some value. Houses are easy to track down (they can't be hidden or moved) in the event that you don't repay your loan. Houses are reasonably liquid, they can be resold to pay off a defaulted loan.<>There are a few reasons why a home loan (mortgage) may be cheaper than a gold loan. One reason is that the interest rates on home loans are generally lower than the interest rates on gold loans. This is because home loans are secured loans, meaning that the lender can seize the borrower's home if they default on the loan. The lender has a greater level of protection with a secured loan, so they are able to offer a lower interest rate.Another reason why a home loan may be cheaper than a gold loan is that the repayment period for a home loan is typically longer than the repayment period for a gold loan. This means that the borrower has more time to pay back the loan, which can make it easier to manage the monthly payments.Finally, the amount of the loan may be a factor in the difference in cost between a home loan and a gold loan. Home loans can be for much larger amounts than gold loans, and the interest rates on large loans tend to be lower than the interest rates on small loans.It's important to note that these are general trends and the specific terms and conditions of a home loan or gold loan will depend on the lender and the borrower's creditworthiness. It's always a good idea to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders before deciding on a loan.<>finance
