Or would we eventually change our mind and decide farts and poop stink ? Explain like I'm five.<>It may be possible to condition us to enjoy \" bad \" smells , but I 'm not sure it would be easy . Our concepts of \" bad smell \" and \" good smell \" are n't social constructs ; they 're a biological phenomena used to keep us away from toxic , dangerous , or rotting foods , and steer us towards safe stuff<>Our sense of smell is based on the ability of our nose to detect and recognize different odors, and what we consider to be good or bad smells is largely based on our experiences and cultural and personal preferences. If we were raised being told that flowers and perfume do not smell good and things like poop and trash smell good, we might initially agree with this because it is what we have been taught. However, over time, as we experience different smells for ourselves and develop our own preferences, we might come to realize that our initial beliefs were incorrect and that we actually prefer the smell of flowers and perfume, and find the smell of poop and trash to be unpleasant. Ultimately, our sense of smell is shaped by a combination of biology and our experiences and beliefs, and it is possible for these to change over time.<>reddit_eli5
