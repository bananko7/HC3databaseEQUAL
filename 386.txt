Dermatitis can have many causes, including allergies, irritants, and underlying medical conditions. It's important to see a dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try using over-the-counter creams like hydrocortisone to help alleviate the symptoms of dryness and itching. It's also a good idea to avoid tight clothing and to keep the affected area clean and dry. If the rash is painful or if it spreads rapidly, or if you have a fever or other symptoms, it's important to see a doctor right away.<>medicine
