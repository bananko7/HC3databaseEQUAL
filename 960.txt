How do people shave in prison ? I was wondering how people shave in prison , are razors allowed and if so does nt that increase the chance of someone being stabbed ? Do jailers have to shave the inmates ? How does it all work ? Please explain like I'm five.<>And before disposable razors were invented , prisoners used locking safety razors like [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . The guards would put in the blade and use the cylinder on the right to tighten the razor together .<>In prison, inmates are usually allowed to have razors for shaving, but the razors are usually disposable and are only used for a short period of time before being thrown away. This is done to reduce the risk of inmates using the razors as weapons. Inmates are generally expected to shave themselves, but in some cases, a jailer or other staff member may assist with shaving if an inmate is unable to do it themselves. To ensure safety, there are usually strict rules in place regarding the use of razors in prison. For example, inmates may only be allowed to shave at certain times of the day and may be required to return the razor to a designated area after they are finished using it. Inmates may also be searched before and after using a razor to make sure it is not being used as a weapon. Overall, the goal is to allow inmates to maintain proper hygiene and appearance while also keeping everyone safe.<>reddit_eli5
