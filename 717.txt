Previous owner of my home wants to buy it back but the property's value is less than my loanâ€¦ what to do?<>A short-sale seems like an extreme and unethical course to take.  You should read your mortgage documents or work with your attorney to read the mortgage and determine whether it is an \"assumable\" mortgage. If so, you might be able to get the former owner to take over the mortgage.<>If the previous owner of your home wants to buy it back and the property's value is less than the amount of your loan, you have a few options to consider. Here are some potential options:Sell the home to the previous owner for the current market value: If the previous owner is willing to pay the current market value of the home, even if it is less than the amount of your loan, you may be able to sell the home to them. This could allow you to recoup some of your investment and move on from the property.Consider a short sale: If the previous owner is not willing or able to pay the full amount of the loan, you may be able to negotiate a short sale with your lender. This involves selling the home for less than the amount of the loan and obtaining permission from the lender to do so. In a short sale, the lender agrees to forgive the remaining balance on the loan.Try to refinance the loan: If you are unable to sell the home or negotiate a short sale, you may be able to refinance the loan to lower the monthly payment. This could involve extending the term of the loan or obtaining a lower interest rate.It's important to carefully consider your options and weigh the pros and cons of each before making a decision. You may want to consult with a financial advisor or real estate attorney for guidance on the best course of action for your specific situation.<>finance
