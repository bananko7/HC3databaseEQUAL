Bruises and blisters are usually caused by some sort of trauma or injury to the skin, such as a blow, a cut, or irritation from friction. It is possible that the coughing may have caused some irritation to the skin on your thighs, but it is not likely to have caused a blister.\n\nIf you are concerned about the bruises and blisters on your thighs, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider. They can examine the area and determine the cause of the bruises and blisters, and provide appropriate treatment if needed. In the meantime, you should continue to use your inhaler as directed by your healthcare provider to help manage your respiratory infection and asthma.<>medicine
