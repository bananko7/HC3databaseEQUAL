Please explain what is \"Computational learning theory\"<>In computer science, computational learning theory (or just learning theory) is a subfield of artificial intelligence devoted to studying the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms.<>Computational learning theory is a subfield of artificial intelligence and computer science that deals with the study of how computers can learn from data. It is concerned with understanding the computational principles underlying machine learning algorithms and their performance limits.\n\n\n\nIn general, machine learning algorithms are used to build models that can make predictions or decisions based on data. These models are usually built by training the algorithm on a dataset, which consists of input data and corresponding output labels. The goal of the learning process is to find a model that accurately predicts the output labels for new, unseen data.\n\n\n\nComputational learning theory aims to understand the fundamental limits of this process, as well as the computational complexity of different learning algorithms. It also investigates the relationship between the complexity of the learning task and the amount of data required to learn it.\n\n\n\nSome of the key concepts in computational learning theory include the concept of a \"hypothesis space,\" which is the set of all possible models that can be learned by the algorithm, and the concept of \"generalization,\" which refers to the ability of the learned model to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n\n\nOverall, computational learning theory provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, as well as for understanding the limitations of these algorithms.<>wiki_csai
