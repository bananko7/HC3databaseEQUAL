how can alcohol be defended even though somebody dies in an \" alcohol related incident \" every fifteen minutes ? I understand that it 's a hugggeee industry , but how can it be defended as being safer compared to marijuana or something similar ? Explain like I'm five.<>The Grandfather clause . Frankly they tried banning alcohol in the 20s-30s and that just led to a dramatic INCREASE in crime .<>It is not accurate to say that alcohol is safer compared to marijuana or any other substance. Both alcohol and marijuana can have negative impacts on a person's health and can be harmful when used excessively or irresponsibly.\r\n\r\nAlcohol is a legal substance for adults to consume in many countries, including the United States, and it is widely available for purchase. This is because alcohol has been a part of many cultures and societies for thousands of years and is often used in social settings to relax and have a good time.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to remember that alcohol can be dangerous if it is not consumed responsibly. This means not drinking too much at one time and not getting behind the wheel of a car or operating heavy machinery while under the influence of alcohol. It is also important to be aware of the risks of binge drinking, which is defined as consuming a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time. Binge drinking can lead to serious health problems and can even be deadly.\r\n\r\nIn short, alcohol can be enjoyed in moderation and as part of a healthy lifestyle, but it is important to be aware of the risks and to consume it responsibly.<>reddit_eli5
