Can pelvic pressure during pregnancy cause premature birth?Hi I'm 19 and am having a second baby but I'm not use to all the symptoms since my first I had none. I keep feeling immense pressure in my pelvis and it kinda feels like I may be dilating but I'm not due till march... There is a family history of premature births on my fathers side so is it possible for me?<>Sometimes pelvic pressure may be due to urinary cause but we are more concerned about premature birth, especially when you had family history. Please get an ultrasound done to denote condition of the mouth of the uterus (cervix) and consult gynecologist.<>Pelvic pressure during pregnancy can sometimes be a sign of preterm labor, which is labor that occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm labor can lead to premature birth, which can be associated with a number of complications for both the mother and the baby.\n\nIf you are experiencing pelvic pressure and are concerned about the possibility of preterm labor, it is important to contact your healthcare provider right away. They will be able to assess your symptoms and determine whether you are at risk of preterm labor. They may recommend a number of measures to help prevent preterm labor, such as bed rest, medications to stop contractions, or other treatments.\n\nIt is also important to note that not all pelvic pressure during pregnancy is a sign of preterm labor. Other factors, such as the baby's position in the uterus or the growth of the uterus, can also cause pelvic pressure. However, if you are concerned about any symptoms you are experiencing during pregnancy, it is always best to speak with your healthcare provider for guidance.<>medicine
