Please explain what is \"Facial recognition system\"<>A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces. Such a system is typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, and works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.\nDevelopment began on similar systems in the 1960s, beginning as a form of computer application. Since their inception, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human's physiological characteristics, facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics. Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition and fingerprint recognition, it is widely adopted due to its contactless process. Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced humanâ€“computer interaction, video surveillance and automatic indexing of images.\nFacial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies. Their effectiveness varies, and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their ineffectiveness. The use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy, with claims that the systems violate citizens' privacy, commonly make incorrect identifications, encourage gender norms and racial profiling, and do not protect important biometric data. The appearance of synthetic media such as deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security. These claims have led to the ban of facial recognition systems in several cities in the United States. As a result of growing societal concerns, Meta announced that it plans to shut down Facebook facial recognition system, deleting the face scan data of more than one billion users. This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology's history.<>Facial recognition is a type of biometric software that uses computer algorithms to map the unique characteristics of an individual's face. This information is then stored in a database, and the system can use it to identify individuals in a digital image or video.\n\n\n\nFacial recognition systems are often used in security applications, such as access control and surveillance. For example, a facial recognition system could be used to verify the identity of a person trying to enter a secure facility, or to identify individuals in a crowd.\n\n\n\nThere are several different ways that facial recognition systems can be designed and implemented. Some systems use 2D images of faces, while others use 3D scans or infrared imaging to capture more detailed information about the shape and structure of a person's face. Some systems are designed to work with static images, while others are designed to recognize faces in video streams.\n\n\n\nFacial recognition technology has raised privacy and civil liberties concerns, as it can be used to track and monitor individuals without their knowledge or consent. There are also concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition systems, particularly when it comes to identifying people of color and women. As a result, there has been significant debate about the use and regulation of facial recognition technology.<>wiki_csai
