As per your query you have symptoms of hair loss which can occur due to many reasons like genetic factor, improper hygiene, fungal infection and hormonal changes. Need not to worry. Mintop 10 is good to use to get proper results and don't stop in between. Apply Indian gooseberries. You should consult dermatologist once for proper examination. Doctor may order skin patch test, blood test, allergic test and physical examination and may prescribe supplements like Omega-3 minoxidil spray, and Vitamin E.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari<>Mintop 10 is a topical solution that contains the active ingredient minoxidil, which is a medication that is used to treat hair loss. It is typically used to treat male-pattern baldness and female-pattern hair loss, but it may also be effective in treating other forms of hair loss.\n\nThe effectiveness of Mintop 10 in treating hair loss will depend on the cause of the hair loss and the individual patient. Some people may see a significant improvement in their hair growth after using Mintop 10, while others may not experience any benefit. It is important to speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare professional to determine the cause of your hair loss and the best treatment approach.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Mintop 10 is not a cure for hair loss, and treatment with this medication will need to be continued in order to maintain any benefits that are achieved. If you stop using Mintop 10, it is likely that your hair loss will return to its previous state.<>medicine
