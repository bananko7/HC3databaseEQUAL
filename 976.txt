Take a break for 6 months atleast to bring your body to normality. Try again naturally for a pregnancy. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. It will increase chance of pregnancy. Hope it helps.<>I'm sorry to hear about your miscarriage and the complications you've been experiencing. It's understandable that you're concerned about the potential impact on future pregnancies.\n\nMiscarriage, especially later in pregnancy, can be a physically and emotionally challenging experience. It's important to allow yourself time to heal both physically and emotionally before trying to conceive again.\n\nIn some cases, a miscarriage can have an impact on future pregnancies. For example, if you had an infection or other medical condition that contributed to the miscarriage, it's possible that this could affect future pregnancies. However, in many cases, a single miscarriage does not have a lasting impact on fertility or the ability to have a healthy pregnancy in the future.\n\nIt's important to speak with your healthcare provider about your specific situation and any concerns you have about future pregnancies. They can assess your overall health, provide guidance on timing for future pregnancies, and address any potential underlying causes of your miscarriage. It's also important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for managing any ongoing bleeding or other complications.<>medicine
