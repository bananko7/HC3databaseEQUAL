If an option's price is 100% made up of its intrinsic value, is there a way to guarantee a non-loss while having a chance at a profit?<>Yes, one such strategy is dividend arbitrage using stock and in the money options. You have to find out which option is the most mispriced before the ex-dividend date.<>If an option's price is 100% made up of its intrinsic value, then the option is said to be \"in the money.\" This means that if you exercise the option, you would receive an immediate profit equal to the option's intrinsic value.In this case, you would not necessarily be guaranteed a profit, but you would at least be guaranteed to not suffer a loss. However, it's important to note that options have expiration dates, so you would need to exercise the option before it expires in order to receive the intrinsic value.If you do not exercise the option before it expires, then you will not receive any profit or loss, as the option will simply expire worthless.It's also worth noting that even if an option is in the money, there is still a chance that the underlying asset could decline in value, which could result in a loss if you decide to sell the asset after exercising the option.<>finance
