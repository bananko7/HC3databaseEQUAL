Why can we move all of our fingers independently of each other minus our ring finger ? Specifically when I have my palm on top of a surface , I can lift all my fingers except my ring finger . Explain like I'm five.<>It 's all about training . Your brain takes as many shortcuts as possible when it 's learning how to move all of your limbs and is happy to lose ability if you do n't use it . This is why physical therapy is so important after an accident or surgery : your brain can develop shortcuts that make things easier in the short run , but harder in the long run . People who work with their hands ( pianists , artists , martial arts practitioners ) can learn to move each finger independently and make use of that range of movement . Otherwise , your brain does n't see the need to keep the extra neurons dedicated to that task and reassigns them to more important work .<>\\nEach of your fingers is controlled by muscles in your hand that are connected to the bones in your finger by tendons. When you want to move a finger, your brain sends a signal to the muscles to contract, which causes the tendons to pull on the bones and move the finger.\\n\\nYour ring finger is just like your other fingers, but it may be slightly more difficult to lift independently because the muscles that control it are smaller than the muscles that control your other fingers. It's also possible that your ring finger is slightly stiffer or has less range of motion than your other fingers, which can make it feel harder to move.\\n\\nRegardless of the reason, it's completely normal for people to have a harder time lifting their ring finger independently. It's just a matter of practice and dexterity, and with enough practice, you should be able to move all of your fingers independently, including your ring finger.<>reddit_eli5
