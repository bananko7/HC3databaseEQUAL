How ( in)accurate is the movie Gravity ? What are the biggest tells that it 's all CGI ? ^May ^contain ^spoilers ^for ^the ^movie Explain like I'm five.<>There is one part of the movie where the protagonist uses the landing rockets to blast herself along an orbit to get to a space station . This is not possible . you ca n't just accelerate in an orbit to get to a different place in the orbit . she would of gone to a higher orbit by speeding up . Also she cries in space and the tears ball up and fly off of her face . the tears would stick to her face and and pool up until they were pushed off or wiped off .<>Gravity is a science fiction film that was released in 2013. It is about two astronauts who are on a mission in space when their space shuttle is destroyed, leaving them stranded and struggling to survive. The movie was praised for its realistic depiction of space travel and the challenges that astronauts face in space.\r\n\r\nHowever, the movie is not completely accurate when it comes to the science of space travel. For example, the movie shows the astronauts moving around in zero gravity, but in reality, objects in space are affected by the gravitational pull of nearby objects, so they do not really experience true zero gravity.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest tells that the movie is mostly CGI (computer-generated imagery) is the fact that the actors are often shown floating in space without any visible means of support, such as a spacecraft or a space suit. In reality, astronauts always wear space suits and are attached to a spacecraft or other structure when they are outside of their spaceship, so they do not float away.\r\n\r\nAnother tell is the fact that the movie shows the Earth and the moon in the same frame, which is not possible in reality because the Earth is much larger than the moon and is much farther away. Finally, the movie shows the astronauts traveling through space at extremely high speeds, which is not possible without the use of specialized propulsion systems.\r\n\r\nOverall, while Gravity is a thrilling and visually stunning movie, it is not entirely accurate when it comes to the science of space travel.<>reddit_eli5
