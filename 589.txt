Please explain what is \"Developmental robotics\"<>Developmental robotics (DevRob), sometimes called epigenetic robotics, is a scientific field which aims at studying the developmental mechanisms, architectures and constraints that allow lifelong and open-ended learning of new skills and new knowledge in embodied machines. As in human children, learning is expected to be cumulative and of progressively increasing complexity, and to result from self-exploration of the world in combination with social interaction. The typical methodological approach consists in starting from theories of human and animal development elaborated in fields such as developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental and evolutionary biology, and linguistics, then to formalize and implement them in robots, sometimes exploring extensions or variants of them. The experimentation of those models in robots allows researchers to confront them with reality, and as a consequence, developmental robotics also provides feedback and novel hypotheses on theories of human and animal development.\nDevelopmental robotics is related to but differs from evolutionary robotics (ER).  ER uses populations of robots that evolve over time, whereas DevRob is interested in how the organization of a single robot's control system develops through experience, over time.\nDevRob is also related to work done in the domains of robotics and artificial life.<>Developmental robotics is a field of robotics that focuses on the design and development of robots that are capable of learning and adapting to their environment over time, much like a human child or animal might. It involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to enable robots to learn from experience and adapt to new situations, as well as to interact with and understand the world around them in a more natural and human-like way.\n\n\n\nDevelopmental robotics research often involves the use of developmental psychology and cognitive science theories to inform the design of robot learning algorithms and behaviors. The ultimate goal of this research is to create robots that are able to learn, adapt, and behave in a way that is similar to how humans and other animals develop and learn over the course of their lives. Such robots could potentially be used in a variety of applications, including education, entertainment, and even healthcare.<>wiki_csai
