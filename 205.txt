Why do movies measure money and not ticket sales ? Similar to album sales , it would be much easier to standardize and compare across eras instead of having every subsequent movie setting some stupid record . Explain like I'm five. <>Because nobody in the film business cares about how many people watched their movie now versus some movie they put out 50 years ago , because it in no way shape or form affects their business . It all comes down to how much money they put in , and how much money they make .<>Movies often measure their success in terms of the amount of money they make at the box office, rather than the number of tickets they sell, because the price of a movie ticket can vary greatly from place to place and from time to time. For example, a movie ticket might cost $10 in one theater and $15 in another theater, and the price of a movie ticket can also change depending on the day of the week or the time of day. By measuring a movie's success in terms of the amount of money it makes at the box office, it's easier to compare the success of different movies, regardless of where or when they were released. So, instead of comparing the number of tickets sold, which can be affected by the price of a ticket, it's easier to just compare the amount of money that the movie made.<>reddit_eli5
