I can understand your concern. First of all you need to confirm diagnosis whether it is ITP or SLE. For that you should go for bone marrow examination and ANA profile.  It will give you exact diagnosis whether your son has ITP or SLE or both.  Then you should start treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.<>Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) is a medication that is commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It works by inhibiting the production of certain immune cells that can attack healthy tissue in the body, which can help reduce inflammation and prevent damage to organs and other tissues.\n\nWhile Cellcept can be effective in controlling the symptoms of SLE, it is important to keep in mind that it is not a cure and may not work for everyone. It can also cause side effects, such as stomach upset, diarrhea, and an increased risk of infections.\n\nIf you are considering starting Cellcept for your son, it is important to discuss the potential risks and benefits with his doctor. It is also important to follow the dosing and administration instructions carefully and to report any side effects to the doctor.\n\nIf you are not satisfied with the treatment your son is receiving or if you have any concerns about his condition, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion from another specialist. It may be useful to consult a rheumatologist, who is a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases such as SLE.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. It is always important to work closely with a healthcare professional to make decisions about your or your loved ones' treatment.<>medicine
