Comprehensive tutorial on double-entry personal finance? <>I found this book to be pretty decent: It is a workbook, and full of little exercises.<>Double-entry accounting is a method of keeping financial records in which every transaction is recorded in at least two accounts. It is based on the principle that every financial transaction has two equal and opposite effects on a company's financial statements. This means that for every debit (expense) recorded in one account, there must be a corresponding credit (income) recorded in another account. The purpose of double-entry accounting is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of a company's financial records by requiring that every transaction be recorded in at least two accounts.Here is a basic tutorial on double-entry accounting for personal finance:Set up a chart of accounts. A chart of accounts is a list of all the accounts that a company uses to record its financial transactions. In personal finance, this might include accounts for cash, investments, liabilities (such as credit card debt), and assets (such as a house or car).Record transactions in the appropriate accounts. When you make a financial transaction, such as paying a bill or receiving a paycheck, you will need to record it in the appropriate accounts in your chart of accounts. For example, if you pay a bill, you would debit the expense account (such as \"utilities\") and credit the cash account.Prepare financial statements. Using the information recorded in your chart of accounts, you can prepare financial statements such as a balance sheet and an income statement. A balance sheet shows the financial position of a company at a specific point in time, including its assets, liabilities, and equity. An income statement shows a company's revenues and expenses over a specific period of time, such as a month or a year.Reconcile your accounts. To ensure the accuracy of your financial records, it is important to regularly reconcile your accounts. This involves comparing the balance in your chart of accounts to your bank statement or other records to make sure everything matches. If there are any discrepancies, you will need to investigate and make any necessary adjustments.Double-entry accounting can seem intimidating at first, but with practice it can be a powerful tool for managing your personal finances and ensuring the accuracy of your financial records.<>finance
