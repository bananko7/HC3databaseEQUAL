What is meant by \" make America great again \" ? How is greatness measured ? And based on this , when was America great ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Nothing in particular . It 's just asserting that , at some point in the past , things were better and we need to get back to that point . What exactly is wrong & when things were \" great \" is largely left up to the reader . It 's not uncommon for political slogans to be highly subjective and devoid of concrete meaning . If you go back to Obama 's \" Change \" campaign , it was largely the same - save the nostalgic call for returning to the past .<>\"Make America Great Again\" is a slogan that was used by Donald Trump during his campaign for President of the United States in 2016 and during his presidency. It means that he wanted to make the country better by improving things and bringing back what some people believe were good things from the past. It is difficult to say exactly what was meant by \"greatness\" in this context, but it might include things like having a strong economy, being respected by other countries, and having a high standard of living. Some people might believe that America was great at different times in the past for different reasons. For example, some people might believe that America was great during the 1950s because the economy was strong and there was a sense of prosperity and stability. Others might believe that America has always been great because of its democratic values and the opportunities it provides to its citizens. It is up to each person to decide for themselves when they think America was great and why.<>reddit_eli5
