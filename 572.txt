Ownership in company and rounds of investment<>Say the company has created 500 shares [or whatever number]. You have 10 shares [equivalent of 2%]. Now when new capital is needed, generally more shares are created. Say they create 100 more shares and sell it to venture capital to raise funds. After this happens; Total Shares: 500+100 = 600 You own: 10 shares Your Ownership % = 1.66% down from 2% Like wise for other older shareholder. The New Venture guy gets 16.66% of ownership.   More funds would mean more growth and overall the value of your 10 shares would be more depending on the valuation.<>Ownership in a company refers to the percentage of the company that an individual or entity owns. This is typically represented in terms of shares of stock in the company. The total number of shares that a company has is fixed, and the ownership of the company is divided among these shares. For example, if a company has 100 shares of stock and an individual owns 20 of them, they own 20% of the company.When a company raises money through investment, it is often done through rounds of investment. These rounds can be divided into two categories: equity financing and debt financing. In equity financing, the company sells ownership stakes in the form of stock to investors in exchange for capital. In debt financing, the company takes out a loan from an investor and agrees to pay it back with interest.There are several different rounds of equity financing that a company may go through as it grows and develops. These rounds are typically referred to as seed funding, series A, series B, and so on. Each round of financing typically represents a different stage of the company's development and a different valuation of the company. As the company raises more money and progresses through these rounds, the percentage of ownership held by the company's founders and early investors may be diluted as new shares are issued to the new investors.<>finance
