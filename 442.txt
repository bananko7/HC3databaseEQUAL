Why do some people go through contortions to avoid paying taxes, yet spend money on expensive financial advice, high-interest loans, etc?<>An example, where I live. When you buy a house, the seller wants 'black' money. This is because that way the seller pays less taxes. However, it's not smart for the buyer to pay in black, as the tax reductions are lower. Eventually, when the buyer tries to sell the house, he has to declare the difference, so a higher buy price should not have affected... apart from the notary minutes.<>There are a variety of reasons why some people may try to avoid paying taxes or may be willing to pay for expensive financial advice or take on high-interest loans in order to do so. Some people may believe that they are paying more in taxes than they should and may be trying to find ways to reduce their tax burden. Others may be trying to maximize their profits or wealth and may see paying taxes as a burden or an unnecessary expense. Some people may also be trying to hide their income or assets in order to evade taxes. It's worth noting that while it is legal to try to minimize one's tax burden through legal means, such as by taking advantage of tax deductions and credits, it is illegal to evade taxes or to intentionally mislead the tax authorities.<>finance
