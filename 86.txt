What is the diffrence between tumor and cancer ?HI DOCTOR my mother is 46yrs recently she is diagnised having heterogenous myometrium(tumor in uterus). i wanted to know is it a cancer ?<>Hi.. Tumor is any abnormal growth of the normal tissue resulting in uncontrolled and unwanted proliferation in a normal tissue.. A growth from the lining of the tissue is known as cancer while the growth from the connective tissue\/muscles is known as sarcoma.. Hope you have understood that...<>A tumor is a mass of abnormal cells that can be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors are not usually a threat to health and do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, are made up of cancer cells that can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis.\n\nIt is not possible for me to accurately determine whether or not your mother's tumor is cancerous without more information. It is important for her to speak with her healthcare provider and undergo appropriate testing and evaluation to determine the nature and extent of the tumor. The healthcare provider will be able to provide more information about the specific type and stage of the tumor, as well as recommend a treatment plan.<>medicine
