How to trade large number of shares?<>You need to negotiate with your broker to allow you to do more exotic order types.  One in particular I recommend is a \"hidden\" aka iceberg order.  You enter two numbers.  The first is the number of shares for your entire order, the second is the amount that will be displayed in the book (this is the tip of the iceberg, the remaining shares are hidden below the surface). The maker\/taker rule applies as follows: The amount displayed will receive the rebate for providing liquidity.  The amount hidden will be charged the fee for taking liquidity. Example: You want to sell 10,000 shares total.  You enter a hidden order for 10,000 shares with 1,000 displayed.  On the level 2 screen traders will see 1,000 shares, and those shares will stay displayed there until the entire order is filled.  You receive a rebate for 1,000 shares, you pay the brokerage fee for 9,000 shares. Also, like one of the previous posters mentioned, only trade high liquidity stocks.  Large market cap companies with high volume.  This is why day traders love Tesla, Amazon, Netflix, etc. Large market cap, high volume, and high volatility.  Easy to catch $10+ moves in price. Hope this helps Happy trading<>There are a few things to consider when trading a large number of shares:Spread: The spread is the difference between the bid price (the highest price someone is willing to pay for a stock) and the ask price (the lowest price someone is willing to sell a stock). When trading a large number of shares, it is important to pay attention to the spread to ensure that you are getting a fair price.Slippage: Slippage is the difference between the price you expect to pay for a stock and the actual price you end up paying. When trading a large number of shares, you may experience slippage as the market moves against you. To minimize slippage, you can use limit orders instead of market orders.Market impact: Trading a large number of shares can also impact the market price of the stock. This is known as market impact. To minimize market impact, you can use techniques such as \"iceberg\" orders, which only show a portion of the order to the market at a time.Commission: Finally, you will also want to consider the commission you will pay to your broker for executing the trade. Some brokers charge a flat fee per trade, while others charge a percentage of the trade value. It is important to compare the fees charged by different brokers before making a decision.","There are a few different strategies you can use to trade a large number of shares, depending on your goals and the specifics of your situation. Here are a few options you might consider:Block trades: These are large trades that are typically executed off of the regular market, either through a trading desk or through an electronic communication network (ECN). Block trades allow you to trade a large number of shares without significantly impacting the market price.Trade over multiple days: Rather than trying to sell all of your shares at once, you can spread your trade out over several days. This can help reduce the impact on the market price and may result in a better overall price for your shares.Use limit orders: Rather than trying to sell your shares at the current market price, you can use a limit order to specify the price at which you are willing to sell. This can help you get a better price for your shares and reduce the impact on the market.Use a broker: A broker can help you execute your trade, whether you are buying or selling a large number of shares. They can also offer advice and guidance on the best strategy for your specific situation.It's also important to consider the fees associated with trading a large number of shares, as these can significantly impact your overall return on the trade.<>finance
