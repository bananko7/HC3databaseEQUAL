What causes pain in the shaft of penis in a 4 year old?My 4 year old son had a bacterial infection in his pen is (uncircumcised) and was given hydro cortisol fucidin cream for a week. The redness and pain was gone after 4 days. But 3 days after that, the head of pen is is blue and painful when we touch the shaft even to wash.<>HIWell come to HCMIf this was the bacterial infection then the medicine that was given to him would not help any more in my opinion he need to be treated with the trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole encourage the child for drinking water, hope this helps.<>It is not normal for a 4 year old to experience pain in the shaft of the penis. It is possible that the bacterial infection has not fully resolved or that your son has developed a new issue. I recommend that you take your son to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. It is important to have a proper diagnosis and treatment plan in order to address any potential health issues and ensure that your son is comfortable. The healthcare provider will be able to examine your son, ask about his symptoms, and determine the cause of the pain and discoloration. They may recommend further treatment or tests to determine the cause of the problem. In the meantime, try to keep the area clean and dry and avoid touching or manipulating the affected area.<>medicine
