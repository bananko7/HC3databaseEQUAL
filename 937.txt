Finding Debt\/Equity Ratio with Market Value of Equity<>In order to calculate the ratio you are looking for, just divide total debt by the market capitalization of the stock. Both values can be found on the link you provided. The market capitalization is the market value of equity.<>The debt-to-equity ratio (also known as the debt-to-equity ratio or the debt-equity ratio) is a financial ratio that measures the relative proportion of a company's debt to its equity. It is calculated by dividing the company's total debt by its total shareholder equity.To calculate the debt-to-equity ratio using the market value of equity, you will need to use the following formula:Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt \/ Market Value of EquityTo calculate the market value of equity, you will need to use the following formula:Market Value of Equity = Market Capitalization - Preferred StockWhere:Market Capitalization is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock, and is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current market price per share.Preferred Stock is the value of a company's preferred stock, which is a type of equity that has a higher claim on a company's assets and earnings than common stock.For example, let's say a company has $100 million in total debt and its market capitalization is $500 million. The company also has $50 million in preferred stock. To calculate the market value of equity for this company, we would use the following formula:Market Value of Equity = $500 million - $50 million = $450 millionTo calculate the debt-to-equity ratio for this company, we would use the following formula:Debt-to-Equity Ratio = $100 million \/ $450 million = 0.22This would mean that the company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.22, which means that its debt represents 22% of its equity.It's important to note that the debt-to-equity ratio is just one of many financial ratios that can be used to evaluate a company's financial health and risk profile. It's generally considered to be a good idea to have a balanced debt-to-equity ratio, as too much debt can make a company vulnerable to financial distress, while too little debt may limit a company's growth potential.<>finance
