Please explain what is \"Warren McCullouch\"<>Warren Sturgis McCulloch (November 16, 1898 â€“ September 24, 1969) was an American neurophysiologist and cybernetician, known for his work on the foundation for certain brain theories and his contribution to the cybernetics movement. Along with Walter Pitts, McCulloch created computational models based on mathematical algorithms called threshold logic which split the inquiry into two distinct approaches, one approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence.<>I'm sorry, but I am not able to find any information on a person named \"Warren McCullouch.\" It is possible that you have misspelled the name or that there is not enough information available about this person for me to provide a summary.
