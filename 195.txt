The difference between Greek yogurt and regular yogurt What is the major difference ? I have been told Greek yogurt is better tasting and better for you ? Can anyone explain the difference ? Explain like I'm five.<>Mostly it 's just regular yogurt strained through cheese cloth .<>Greek yogurt and regular yogurt are both made from milk, but Greek yogurt is made differently than regular yogurt. To make Greek yogurt, the milk is first heated and then cooled to a specific temperature. Then, bacteria are added to the milk to ferment it and turn it into yogurt. After the fermentation process is complete, the yogurt is strained to remove the whey, which is a liquid that separates from the yogurt during the fermentation process. This process results in a thicker, creamier, and protein-rich yogurt.\n\nRegular yogurt is also made from milk and bacteria, but it is not strained after the fermentation process. This means that it has a thinner consistency and contains more water than Greek yogurt.\n\nSome people think that Greek yogurt tastes better than regular yogurt because it is thicker and creamier. It is also higher in protein and lower in sugar than regular yogurt, which makes it a healthier option for people who are looking to increase their protein intake or reduce their sugar intake.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
