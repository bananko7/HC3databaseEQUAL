- Gabriel 's horn , I just do n't get it . URL_0 Please , Explain this to me like I 'm five , I do n't get it at all . Explain like I'm five.<>The small tail end keeps going indefinitely , thus the surface area keeps going ( since the surface area is calculated by multiplying by the length , which is an infinite number . ) . Before we talk about volume , remember that 0.999999999999 ..... = 1 . 99.9999 % of the volume is at the larger end of the cone and it decreases as it gets towards the end , so even though the surface area keeps going , the volume will not increase enough to round it up to a number that matters . [ Here 's a good visual representitive ] ( URL_0 ) . Does n't matter how long it can go on , the digits towards the end will not make it round up to 1 .<>Sure! Gabriel's horn is a shape that looks like a horn, but it has a special property. If you were to pour an infinite amount of paint into Gabriel's horn, it would still have no volume! This is because the horn has a curved shape that gets smaller and smaller the further you go in. Imagine taking a roll of paper and curling it into a horn shape, with one end being small and the other end being bigger. If you start at the bigger end and try to pour paint into the horn, the paint would fill up the space inside the horn. But as you move towards the smaller end, the space inside the horn gets smaller and smaller. Eventually, the space inside the horn becomes so small that no matter how much paint you pour, it wouldn't be able to fit inside the horn. This is why Gabriel's horn has no volume, even though it looks like it has a lot of space inside. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>reddit_eli5
