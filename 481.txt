Is CLL affected by testosterone therapy?I am a 59 year-old-male who was diagnosed with CLL about one and one half years ago.  No symptoms at this time except possibly a little fatigue.  I also suspect that I may have a low testosterone level because I don't have much hair on my legs any more, energy level is down, weight has increased a bit, and sexual desire is a bit diminished.  My question is whether or not testosterone therapy will have any effect on CLL.<>Hi,Thanks for writing in.Testosterone therapy is unlikely to influence development and progress of CLL. Once you have CLL it is better to get a follow up done since it has been one and a half year from detection which is not many days back. Please get your blood tests and ultrasound scan done to know if you have any features of CLL.Diminishing of sexual desire is present in many patients of CLL during recovery and you appear to have had CLL only recently and recovery is taking place slowly. However your fatigue requires to be investigated and if you need to continue treatment for CLL. Please do not worry.<>It is generally not recommended to use testosterone therapy in individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
