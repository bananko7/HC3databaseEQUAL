what are private labels<>Private label products or services are typically those manufactured or provided by one company for offer under another company's brand .<>Private labels are products that are produced by one company and sold under another company's brand name. Private labeling is a common practice in the retail industry, where a retailer will work with a manufacturer to produce a product that is exclusive to the retailer and carries the retailer's brand. Private labels are often created to offer customers a lower-priced alternative to national brands, or to offer a unique product that is not available from other retailers. Private labeling can also help retailers differentiate themselves from their competitors by offering a unique product selection. Private labels are often referred to as \"store brands\" or \"generic brands.\"","Private labels are products that are produced by one company but are sold under the brand name of another company. For example, a company might produce a line of products such as snacks or cleaning products and sell them to a retailer, who then puts their own brand name on the product and sells it to consumers. Private label products are often similar to products that are already on the market, but they may be sold at a lower price because they do not have the same marketing and advertising costs as the brand name products. Private labels can be a good option for consumers who are looking for high-quality products at a lower price, and they can also be a good option for companies that want to offer their own branded products without the expense and time involved in developing and producing them from scratch.","Private labels are products that are produced by one company and sold under another company's brand. These products are often made to the specification of the retailer or brand that will sell them, and the retailer or brand will typically have exclusive rights to sell the product. Private label products can be found in a variety of industries, including food, clothing, and household goods. Many retailers and brands use private labeling as a way to offer unique products to their customers without having to invest in the research and development of those products themselves. Private label products can also be a cost-effective alternative to buying branded products, as they are usually less expensive to produce.<>open_qa
