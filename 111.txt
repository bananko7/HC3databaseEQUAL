Cellular and deep penetrating fibrous histiocytoma, CD43 positive in blood vessels. Cancer?I have recently been told that a lesion removed from my leg is cellular and deep penetrating fibrous histiocytoma.My doctor wants to do a wider excision of the area again. He said he is confident about the outcome but local recurrence can happen. Is this cancer?  It said in the report it was CD43 positive in blood vessels.<>Fibrous histiocytoma is a type of tumor that does not spread to other parts of the body. However it is a locally aggressive tumor and recurs locally even after adequate surgery. So, recurrence at the same site after inadequate surgery is almost sure shot. Thus, a wide excision of the area is mandatory. As, i said, local recurrence can still happen, but the chances are much less. CD 43 positivity in this setting means nothing and doesnt change either the outcome or the treatment plan.<>Cellular and deep penetrating fibrous histiocytoma is a type of benign (non-cancerous) skin tumor that is usually found on the legs or arms. It is a rare tumor that typically affects young adults and children. While it is not cancerous, it can recur locally after surgical excision.\n\nCD43 is a protein that is expressed on the surface of certain types of cells, including some types of immune cells. The presence of CD43 in the blood vessels of the tumor may suggest that the tumor is related to immune cells or that the immune system is involved in the development of the tumor. However, it is not clear how CD43 expression in this context would affect the treatment or prognosis of the tumor.\n\nIt is important to discuss the specifics of your case with your doctor and follow their recommended treatment plan. Wider excision of the area may be necessary to ensure that all of the tumor is removed and to minimize the risk of recurrence. Regular follow-up with your doctor and close monitoring of the treated area can also help to detect any potential recurrences early.<>medicine
