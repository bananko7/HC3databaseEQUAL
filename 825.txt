What stops humans from sleeping for days at a time ? Bears hibernate up to 6 months , why ca n't we ? Explain like I'm five.<>One reason is that you ca n't store as much nutritients as a bear can . Your body is not situated to do this . Bears store nutritients to hibernate in periods where they would lack food and overall the period where they would n't be happy to live in . If that makes sense .<>Bears are able to sleep for long periods of time because they are able to slow down their body's functions and use stored fat as energy while they sleep. Humans are not able to do this because we need to eat food to get energy and we also need to stay hydrated. If we don't eat or drink anything, our bodies will become weak and we will feel very sick.\n\nSleeping is also important for humans because it helps our bodies and minds rest and repair themselves. When we sleep, our bodies release special chemicals that help to repair and grow new cells, and our brains also use this time to process and organize information from the day. If we don't get enough sleep, we can become tired and have trouble concentrating, remembering things, and making decisions.\n\nSo, while bears are able to sleep for long periods of time because of the way their bodies are able to function, humans need to eat and drink regularly and get a good amount of sleep in order to stay healthy and strong.<>reddit_eli5
