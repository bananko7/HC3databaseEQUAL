Why do companies like Intel and Lockheed Martin advertise on tv ? The products they offer are useless to most people , and the people who do need them already know who they are . What 's the point of it ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Its a mix of getting the attention of those few people that may actually be interested in buying their products , as well as advertising to those who would consider working for their companies ( engineers , scientists , sometimes business majors or economists ) .<>Advertising can serve many different purposes for a company. One reason that companies like Intel and Lockheed Martin might advertise on TV is to increase brand awareness. This means that they want more people to know about their company and the products they offer. Even though the products they offer may not be useful to most people, they may still want to increase awareness of their brand so that they can attract more customers or clients in the long run. Another reason a company might advertise is to promote a new product or service that they are launching. By advertising on TV, they can reach a large audience and let people know about the new thing they are offering. Advertising can also help a company to differentiate themselves from their competitors and position themselves as a leader in their industry. By using TV ads to communicate the features and benefits of their products or services, a company can try to persuade people to choose them over their competitors. Overall, the goal of advertising is to promote the company and its products or services to a wider audience, and TV is just one way that companies can do that.<>reddit_eli5
