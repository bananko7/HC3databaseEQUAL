How is it true that we have not surpassed the computing power of the human brain through technology when our machines do calculations that no human can ? Computers can do different calculations millions of times per second when the average human takes some time to complete one Explain like I'm five.<>Because we have n't yet figured out the calculation that leads to the feeling you get when you read the end of Old Yeller .<>Even though computers can perform many calculations very quickly, they are not as good as humans at some tasks. For example, computers are not very good at understanding and interpreting language or recognizing patterns and objects in images. They also have trouble with tasks that require common sense or problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, computers are very good at performing repetitive tasks over and over again without getting tired or making mistakes. They can also perform many calculations at the same time, which is something that humans cannot do.\r\n\r\nSo, while computers are very good at some things, they are not as good as humans at other things. That is why we say that computers have not yet surpassed the computing power of the human brain.<>reddit_eli5
