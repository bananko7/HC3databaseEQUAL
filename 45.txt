Why does smoking marijuana allegedly not contribute to lung cancer ? I read somewhere that smoking marijuana does not contribute to lung cancer . Why ? Explain like I'm five. <>Well , it does . The difference is that most people smoke one or maybe two joints a day .. or less . While tobacco smokers count their habit in packs of twenty .<>Smoking marijuana does not directly cause lung cancer, according to most research studies. However, smoking marijuana can still damage your lungs and cause other health problems. When you smoke marijuana, you inhale many of the same chemicals that are found in tobacco smoke, and these chemicals can harm your lungs and airways. Some studies have also suggested that smoking marijuana regularly over a long period of time could increase the risk of lung infections or other respiratory problems. It's important to remember that even though marijuana may not directly cause lung cancer, it is still a drug and can have harmful effects on the body.<>reddit_eli5
