Please explain what is \"Markov decision process\"<>In mathematics, a Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete-time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains.\nAt each time step, the process is in some state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n, and the decision maker may choose any action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n that is available in state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n, and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward \n\n\n\n\nR\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n′\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}\n\n.\nThe probability that the process moves into its new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n is influenced by the chosen action. Specifically, it is given by the state transition function \n\n\n\n\nP\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n′\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}\n\n. Thus, the next state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n depends on the current state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and the decision maker's action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. But given \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions; in other words, the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property.\nMarkov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains; the difference is the addition of actions (allowing choice) and rewards (giving motivation). Conversely, if only one action exists for each state (e.g. \"wait\") and all rewards are the same (e.g. \"zero\"), a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain.<>A Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. It is used to represent the dynamic behavior of a system, in which the current state of the system depends on both the actions taken by the decision maker and the probabilistic outcomes of those actions.\n\n\n\nIn an MDP, a decision maker (also known as an agent) takes actions in a series of discrete time steps, transitioning the system from one state to another. At each time step, the agent receives a reward based on the current state and action taken, and the reward influences the agent's future decisions.\n\n\n\nMDPs are often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve problems involving sequential decision making, such as controlling a robot or deciding which investments to make. They are also used in operations research and economics to model and analyze systems with uncertain outcomes.\n\n\n\nAn MDP is defined by a set of states, a set of actions, and a transition function that describes the probabilistic outcomes of taking a given action in a given state. The goal in an MDP is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time, given the transition probabilities and rewards for each state and action. This can be done using techniques such as dynamic programming or reinforcement learning.<>wiki_csai
