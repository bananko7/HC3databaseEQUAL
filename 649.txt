Please explain what is \"Time complexity\"<>In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.: 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\nlog\n⁡\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n\\log n)}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\nα\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{\\alpha })}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\n2\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(2^{n})}\n\n, etc., where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input.\nAlgorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. For example, an algorithm with time complexity \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n is a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with time complexity \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\nα\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{\\alpha })}\n\n for some constant \n\n\n\nα\n>\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha >1}\n\n is a polynomial time algorithm.<>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, which describes the amount of time it takes for the algorithm to run as a function of the size of the input data. Time complexity is important because it helps to determine the speed of an algorithm, and it is a useful tool for comparing the efficiency of different algorithms.\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to express time complexity, but the most common is using \"big O\" notation. In big O notation, the time complexity of an algorithm is expressed as an upper bound on the number of steps the algorithm takes, as a function of the size of the input data. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) takes at most a certain number of steps for each element in the input data. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) takes at most a certain number of steps for each possible pair of elements in the input data.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that time complexity is a measure of the worst-case performance of an algorithm. This means that the time complexity of an algorithm describes the maximum amount of time it could take to solve a problem, rather than the average or expected amount of time.\n\n\n\nThere are many factors that can affect the time complexity of an algorithm, including the type of operations it performs and the specific input data it is given. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and it is often important to choose the most efficient algorithm for a particular problem in order to save time and resources.<>wiki_csai
