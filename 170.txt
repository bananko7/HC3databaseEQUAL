Hiccups ! why ? ! I keep reading that no one really knows why or how they happen . Can someone explain why they happen ? Explain like I'm five.<>It 's like a cramp . Ever get those when you run too much or bend your leg the wrong way ? Well , when you breathe in , there 's a muscle that does that , called the \" diaphragm . \" And instead of getting cramped , like most muscles do when they 're unhappy , the diaphragm kinda twitches , making you breathe in really hard all of a sudden . That 's what we call a hiccup .<>Hiccups are caused by a sudden, involuntary contraction of the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen and helps you breathe. When the diaphragm contracts suddenly, it causes a person to inhale quickly, which can make the vocal cords snap shut and produce the \"hic\" sound that is characteristic of hiccups. There are many things that can cause the diaphragm to contract suddenly and cause hiccups, such as eating too quickly, drinking carbonated beverages, or having a full stomach. Hiccups can also be caused by certain medications, infections, or medical conditions such as acid reflux. In most cases, hiccups are not a serious problem and will go away on their own after a short period of time. However, if hiccups last for a long time or are causing discomfort, there are a few things that you can try to help stop them, such as holding your breath, swallowing sugar, or drinking a glass of water upside down.<>reddit_eli5
