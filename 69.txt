Please explain what is \"Deep structure\"<>Deep structure and surface structure (also D-structure and S-structure although those abbreviated forms are sometimes used with distinct meanings) are concepts used in linguistics, specifically in the study of syntax in the Chomskyan tradition of transformational generative grammar.\nThe deep structure of a linguistic expression is a theoretical construct that seeks to unify several related structures.  For example, the sentences \"Pat loves Chris\" and \"Chris is loved by Pat\" mean roughly the same thing and use similar words.  Some linguists, Chomsky in particular, have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct surface forms that derive from a common (or very similar) deep structure.<>In linguistics, the term \"deep structure\" refers to the underlying meaning and structure of a sentence or phrase, which is thought to be the source of the surface structure or the way that the sentence is actually expressed. This concept was developed by Noam Chomsky and his followers as part of their theory of transformational grammar, which proposes that the deep structure of a sentence is transformed into its surface structure through a series of rules.\n\n\n\nAccording to this theory, the deep structure of a sentence consists of the underlying syntactic and semantic relationships between the words and phrases in the sentence. It is thought to be the source of the various surface structures that a sentence can have, depending on the context in which it is used and the rules that are applied to transform it.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider the following sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" This sentence has a simple deep structure that consists of a subject (\"the cat\"), a verb (\"sat\"), and an object (\"the mat\"). The surface structure of this sentence is the specific way that it is expressed, with the words arranged in a particular order and with specific inflections applied to the verb.\n\n\n\nDeep structure is an important concept in linguistics because it helps to explain how the meaning of a sentence is conveyed and how different surface structures can be derived from a single deep structure. It is also a key component of many theories of language and how it is processed in the brain.<>wiki_csai
