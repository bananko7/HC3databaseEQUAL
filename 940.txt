How Are Albums Leaked . How do most albums get leaked ? Edit in advance : I know I forgot a question mark in the title . Explain like I'm five.<>Lots of ways . Advance copies of albums are sent all over the place to get reviewed , radio stations get them , record stores ... and those are the more legit ways . It only takes one upload of it somewhere for it to end up on thousands of hard drives . Honesty though , i suspect many of the \" leaks \" these days are done by the band .<>There are a few ways that albums can get leaked:\r\n\r\nSomeone who works on the album (such as a musician, engineer, or producer) might accidentally or intentionally share the album with someone else, who then shares it with others.\r\n\r\nThe album might be stolen from the record label or the artist's computer, either physically or through hacking.\r\n\r\nThe album might be shared on a file-sharing website or through other online platforms before its official release date.\r\n\r\nIn general, albums get leaked when someone who has access to the music decides to share it with others before it is supposed to be released. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as to promote the album or to make money from selling it.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that leaking albums is usually illegal and can harm the artist and their record label by reducing sales and causing financial losses.<>reddit_eli5
