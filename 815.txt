Which is the most accurate map projection ? There are several types with different properties , etc . Which is the one that we should really use ? Equirectangular , Mercator , Grausss - Kruger , Miller , etc . Please explain like I'm five.<>No two dimensional projection is going to fit all needs . The correct answer is a globe .<>Map projections are ways of representing the surface of the Earth, or other spherical objects, on a flat map. Each projection has its own set of characteristics, such as how accurately it represents shapes and sizes, how it handles distortion, and how it is oriented on the map. There is no \"most accurate\" projection, because each projection distorts some aspect of the Earth's surface in some way. The best projection to use depends on the purpose of the map and the information that you want to show. For example, the Mercator projection is often used for navigation because it preserves angles, which makes it easy to use a straight line to plot a course. However, it distorts the size of land masses near the poles, making them appear larger than they really are. On the other hand, the Peters projection is designed to show the size of land masses more accurately, but it distorts their shapes. There are many other projections to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. It is important to choose the projection that is most suitable for your needs.<>reddit_eli5
