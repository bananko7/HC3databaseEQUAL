institutional ownership â€” why is it so convoluted<>The reason for such differences is that there's no source to get this information. The companies do not (and cannot) report who are their shareholders except for large shareholders and stakes of interest. These, in the case of GoPro, were identified during the IPO (you can look the filings up on EDGAR). You can get information from this or that publicly traded mutual fund about their larger holdings from their reports, but private investors don't provide even that. Institutional (public) investors buy and sell shares all the time and only report large investments. So there's no reliable way to get a snapshot picture you're looking for.<>Institutional ownership refers to the percentage of a company's outstanding shares that are held by institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, and investment firms. Institutional ownership can be a complex and convoluted topic because it can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and diversity of the institutional investor base, the investment strategies of the institutions, and the regulatory environment in which the institutions operate.There are several reasons why institutional ownership can be complex:Institutional investors are diverse: Institutional investors come in many different forms, including mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, and investment firms. These institutions may have different investment objectives, risk tolerances, and investment horizons, which can affect their ownership of a particular company's shares.Institutional ownership can be fluid: Institutions may buy and sell shares of a company based on a variety of factors, including changes in the company's financial performance, the overall market conditions, or their own investment strategies. This can lead to fluctuations in the level of institutional ownership over time.Institutional investors are subject to regulations: Institutions are subject to various regulations that can affect their ownership of a company's shares. For example, mutual funds may be restricted in the percentage of a company's shares they are allowed to own, and hedge funds may be required to disclose their holdings to regulatory agencies.Institutional ownership can be difficult to track: It can be challenging to accurately track institutional ownership of a company's shares, as institutions are not required to disclose their holdings on a regular basis. This makes it difficult for investors to get a complete picture of the level of institutional ownership in a particular company.Overall, institutional ownership can be a complex and convoluted topic because it is influenced by a wide range of factors, including the diversity of the institutional investor base, the fluid nature of institutional ownership, the regulatory environment, and the difficulty in tracking institutional holdings.<>finance
