It is not uncommon for a small number of white blood cells to be present in semen, as the prostate gland and other reproductive structures produce small amounts of white blood cells as part of their normal function. However, an increased number of white blood cells in the semen can be a sign of infection or inflammation.\n\nIt is important to follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment, as untreated infections or inflammation in the reproductive tract can have serious consequences, including reduced fertility and an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of the increased white blood cells in your semen and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nAs for the question of pregnancy, the presence of pus cells in the semen alone is not necessarily a barrier to pregnancy. However, if the pus cells are a result of an infection or inflammation, it is important to address and treat the underlying condition in order to optimize your chances of fertility and a healthy pregnancy.<>medicine
