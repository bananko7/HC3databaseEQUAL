What is the .1 % of bacteria that Lysol does n't kill ? Lysol claims to kill 99.9 % of bacteria Please explain like I'm five.<>They do that so if it does n't kill all the germs they ca n't be sued for false advertising .<>Lysol is a disinfectant that is designed to kill a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, and other germs. It is generally very effective at doing this, but like all disinfectants, it is not perfect and there may be some types of bacteria that it does not kill. \nThe .1% of bacteria that Lysol does not kill refers to the small number of bacteria that are able to survive after being exposed to Lysol. This may be because these particular bacteria are resistant to the ingredients in Lysol, or because they are able to survive in small numbers even when most of their population is killed off. \nIt is important to note that while Lysol is generally very effective at killing bacteria, it is not a substitute for proper hand hygiene and other infection prevention measures. It is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water, cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and practice social distancing to help prevent the spread of infections.<>reddit_eli5
