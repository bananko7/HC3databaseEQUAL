Why do countries with nuclear weapons have significantly more nukes than there are cities that they 'd ever even consider nuking ? For example , the US has over 4,000 , and at one point had over 30,000 . Explain like I'm five. <>Because once a nuclear war starts your first move is to go for the other guys nukes . So , if you have three times as many as you need , then you can afford to have 2\/3rds of your subs , silos , and bombers destroyed . In the same respect , nuclear missile defense also lowered the effectiveness of nuclear weapons , causing people to solve he problem by just overwhelming the system with more and more warheads .<>Countries with nuclear weapons have significantly more nuclear weapons than they would need to destroy cities because they want to have a strong deterrent against other countries with nuclear weapons. Having a lot of nuclear weapons shows other countries that you are prepared to defend yourself and that you have the ability to cause a lot of damage if someone attacks you. It's kind of like having a big, loud dog to protect your home. Even if you don't plan on using the dog to attack anyone, just having it there can make other people think twice about trying to break in.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the goal of having nuclear weapons is not to actually use them, but rather to prevent them from being used by others. This is known as \"deterrence.\" Countries with nuclear weapons hope that by having a strong deterrent, they can prevent other countries from using their nuclear weapons against them.<>reddit_eli5
