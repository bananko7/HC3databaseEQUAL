It will resolve on its own.You just need to do warm saline rinses.Complete your course of medicines as told by your dentist.Visit your dentist for check-up.RegardsDr. Neha Sumra<>It is not uncommon to have swelling and bumps in the mouth after wisdom tooth extraction. These bumps may be due to swelling or the formation of small blood clots, which can be normal after oral surgery. However, it is important to keep an eye on the bumps and any other symptoms you are experiencing, such as a sore throat, to ensure that they are not a sign of an infection or other issue.\n\nIf you are concerned about the bumps or your sore throat, it is best to consult with your oral surgeon or a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance. They can assess your mouth and throat and determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to follow your oral surgeon's instructions for caring for your mouth after the surgery, including keeping the area clean and avoiding hard or crunchy foods that may irritate the bumps or cause further swelling.<>medicine
