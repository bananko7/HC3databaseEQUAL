It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of linguistic and cognitive development. For proper diagnosis, you can consult a psychiatrist. Thanks<>It is important to note that it is not appropriate for me to diagnose individuals with conditions, as I am just a computer program and do not have the ability to examine individuals in person. If you are concerned about your son's behavior, it is important to speak with a medical professional, such as a doctor or a mental health professional. They will be able to assess your son and determine if he may have a condition such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), also known as autism, or if there may be another cause for his behavior.\n\nSymptoms of autism spectrum disorder can vary widely and may include difficulty with social communication and interactions, repetitive behaviors or interests, and challenges with sensory processing. It is important to remember that every individual is unique and may experience symptoms differently. If you are concerned about your son's behavior, it is important to speak with a medical professional who can help determine the best course of action.<>medicine
