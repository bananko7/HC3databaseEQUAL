So i had given 5 ml of Mefanorm? I could see the fever is getting reduced slowly now. What would be the next course of action if the fever returns in less than 6 hours again?<>Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Use warm shower and wet clothes from time to time when you see that the temp is increasing because it helps. I will also suggest to use also Ibuprofen syrup to alternate the other syrup you are taking to have a better result. Of course if your child have more than 3 days with temp than you should see a doctor. Hope I have answered your query.
