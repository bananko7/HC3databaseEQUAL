Why can a computer only uninstall one program at a time ? A computer can run hundreds upon hundreds of tasks at once but when asked to remove more than one program from its hard drive at a time it ca n't . Please explain like I'm five.<>Uninstalling a program is n't just removing some files ( you can set up deletion of more than one files or file groups at the same time ) . It means that your system needs to check up any registry entries , filetype associations , quick menu additions and shared resources . If you were uninstalling two applications simultaneously they might interfere with eachother leaving some files behind in the best case , or making the system unstable , usually with no way of telling what got broken .<>When you ask a computer to uninstall a program, the computer has to go through and remove all of the files and settings associated with that program. If the computer tried to remove multiple programs at the same time, it might get confused about which files belong to which program and it might accidentally remove important files. It's like if you were trying to clean up your bedroom and you had to throw away a bunch of toys. If you tried to throw away more than one toy at a time, you might accidentally throw away something important, like a favorite stuffed animal. So it's safer for the computer to just take things one at a time.<>reddit_eli5
