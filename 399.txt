Please explain what is \"Harvard Mark I\"<>The Harvard Mark I, or IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC), was a general-purpose electromechanical computer used in the war effort during the last part of World War II.\nOne of the first programs to run on the Mark I was initiated on 29 March 1944 by John von Neumann. At that time, von Neumann was working on the Manhattan Project, and needed to determine whether implosion was a viable choice to detonate the atomic bomb that would be used a year later. The Mark I also computed and printed mathematical tables, which had been the initial goal of British inventor Charles Babbage for his \"analytical engine\" in 1837.\nThe Mark I was disassembled in 1959, but portions of it were displayed in the Science Center as part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments until being moved to the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston, Massachusetts in July 2021. Other sections of the original machine had much earlier been transferred to IBM and the Smithsonian Institution.<>The Harvard Mark I was an electromechanical computer built at Harvard University in the late 1930s. It was one of the first computers to use punched paper tape as a method of input and output, and it was also one of the first computers to use relays as logic gates. The Harvard Mark I was developed in collaboration with IBM, and it was used for a variety of purposes, including the computation of ballistic tables for the United States Navy. It was in operation from 1944 until 1959, and it played a significant role in the development of modern computing.<>wiki_csai
