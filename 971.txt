Does Nano-Leo help with sperm morphology and low sperm count?We went for fertility issues. Doctor prescribed me Nano-leo even though I don t have ED problem or low testosterone problem. My issue is more with sperm morphology (2% strict kruger) or lowish count (40m\/ml) but according to the info on web Nano-Leo does not help with that. Should I still take it?<>Hello, it is not a good option and thus you need to get proper hormone profile done and then take necessary hormones and drugsIn case you have any questions in future you can contact me directly on http:\/\/bit.ly\/drmanishajain<>Nano-Leo is a dietary supplement that contains a combination of ingredients, including L-arginine, which is an amino acid that has been suggested to improve blood flow and circulation. Some people claim that Nano-Leo may help improve fertility and treat erectile dysfunction (ED). However, there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims.\n\nIt is important to note that Nano-Leo is not a medication and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. If you are concerned about fertility issues, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional who can properly diagnose and treat any underlying medical conditions. While supplements like Nano-Leo may be marketed as fertility aids, there is no guarantee that they will be effective, and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\nIf you have been prescribed Nano-Leo by a healthcare professional, it is important to follow their instructions and to discuss any concerns or questions you may have about its use. It is also important to speak with your healthcare professional about the best course of treatment for your specific fertility issues. They may recommend a combination of treatments, such as lifestyle changes, medication, or assisted reproductive technologies, depending on the cause of your fertility issues and your individual circumstances.<>medicine
