I can't produce a title for a vehicle I just traded<>If your fianc√©e took a title loan out on your truck you won't be able to trade it in for another vehicle until you pay the loan. The dealer will likely take your \"slightly newer\" truck back because you won't be able to produce the title for the trade until the other debt is settled. Title loans are a terrible idea. You should probably try to pay that loan off as quickly as possible regardless, because interest rates are terrible on these loans.  I will update this answer if you add details about the circumstances of the current loan on your truck.<>If you have traded your vehicle and are unable to produce the title, you will need to contact the previous owner or the dealership or individual that you traded the vehicle with and ask for a copy of the title. In some cases, the previous owner may have misplaced the title or may have never transferred the title into their name after purchasing the vehicle. In these cases, you may need to obtain a duplicate title or a replacement title in order to transfer ownership of the vehicle to the new owner.To obtain a duplicate or replacement title, you will need to contact your local department of motor vehicles (DMV) or similar agency and provide them with the necessary documentation, such as the vehicle's identification number (VIN) and proof of ownership. You may also need to pay a fee to obtain a duplicate or replacement title.If you are unable to obtain a copy of the title from the previous owner or the dealership or individual that you traded the vehicle with, you may need to seek legal assistance in order to resolve the issue and transfer ownership of the vehicle to the new owner.<>finance
