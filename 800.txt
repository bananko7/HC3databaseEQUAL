Why do most of us forget our dreams ? And some remember every minute of it ? EXPLAINED ! Explain like I'm five.<>You remember your dreams vividly as soon as you wake up , but you begin forgetting immediately . Keep a journal next to your bed and the second you wake up , start writing down what you just dreamt about . Eventually you will remember your dreams in full detail and even begin to dream lucidly ... which is pretty damn awesome .<>When we sleep, our brains go into a different state than when we are awake. During this time, our brains are still active and we often have experiences called dreams. Dreams can be very strange and hard to understand because they are not based in reality.\r\n\r\nSometimes we wake up from a dream and can remember it very vividly. Other times, we wake up and don't remember anything about our dream at all. This is because our brains are not as active when we are in a deep sleep, so it is harder to remember things that happen during that time.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that we forget our dreams because we don't pay very much attention to them when we are asleep. If we don't think about our dreams when we wake up, it can be hard to remember them later. Some people are better at remembering their dreams because they are more interested in them and make an effort to write them down or think about them after they wake up.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, we forget most of our dreams because our brains are not as active when we are in a deep sleep, and because we don't pay very much attention to them when we wake up. Some people are better at remembering their dreams because they are more interested in them and make an effort to remember them.<>reddit_eli5
