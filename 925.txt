If we die after roughly 3 weeks without eating , why do eat 3 times a day ? I know you would n't spend 3 weeks very wealthy or you would lack energy , but still , it seems it 's some sort of waste . Explain like I'm five.<>Eating three times a day is actually a modern invention ( modern in terms of human history as a species ) . It was n’t uncommon , or even unhealthy to eat once a day , or sometimes skip a day every few days . It still is n’t unhealthy to do that today , you are just so used to eating three times a day that it would be difficult . We die after 3 weeks of not eating because we are healthy and well nourished . If you ate rarely and were malnourished you would die much quicker . We eat daily to make sure we are in top health .<>Eating three times a day is a habit that has developed over time and is not necessarily based on how long a person can go without eating. The human body needs a constant supply of nutrients to function properly, and eating small meals throughout the day can help provide the body with the energy and nutrients it needs. Eating three times a day also helps to regulate blood sugar levels and can prevent overeating or eating too much at once, which can lead to weight gain. In addition, eating regular meals can help improve overall health and prevent certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. It's important to remember that everyone's nutritional needs are different, and the amount and frequency of meals that are right for one person may not be the same for another. It's important to talk to a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine the right meal plan for your individual needs.<>reddit_eli5
