Could breathing difficulties suggest asthma?Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?Please type your query here.Hi Dr my elder sister age 29 married having breathing problem during walk in steps and doing heavy work and walking, Dr says that the symptoms are like asthma initial stage, please kindly suggest me what is the exact problem she had.<>Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history.I would like to ask you a few more questions like - Does she have other allergies? Does she have wheezing after walking? Does she have chest pain, palpitation, excessive sweating, etc? However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to your sister:1. If she has other allergies or wheezing, asthma is very likely. In that case, I would prescribe her salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-neede basis. I would also suggest her allergy testing so that she may identify the substances which are causing troubles to her and to avoid them. Regular breathing exercise will help her.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her to get her hemoglobin levels done. If they are low, they can cause breathing problem after heavy work\/exercise. In that case, iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and other nutrition supplements will be useful.3. If any of above is not there, I would like to ask her symptoms in great detail to know whether she needs a cardiac evaluation. As she is young (29 years), anemia and asthma are more common possibilities rather than cardiac disease. However, it is important to diagnose the cause of her breathlessness.Hope above answer will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you sister the best of the health.Thank you & Regards.<>Breathing difficulties can be a symptom of asthma, but they can also be caused by other conditions. It is important for your sister to see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and determine the cause of her breathing difficulties.\n\nAsthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which can lead to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. These symptoms may be triggered by various factors, including exercise, exposure to allergens or irritants, and respiratory infections.\n\nIf your sister's doctor has suggested that she may have asthma, it is important for her to follow their recommendations for treatment and management. This may include taking medications to control symptoms, avoiding triggers that can worsen her asthma, and monitoring her breathing regularly. It is also important for her to see her doctor regularly to track her progress and adjust her treatment as needed.<>medicine
