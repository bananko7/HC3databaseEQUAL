Why aren't bond mutual funds seeing huge selloffs now? <>Since 1971, mortgage interest rates have never been more than .25% below current rates (3.6%).  Even restricting just to the last four years, rates have been as much as .89% higher.  Overall, we're much closer to the record low interest rate than any type of high.  We're currently at a three-year low.   Yes, we should expect interest rates to go up.  Eventually.  Maybe when that happens, bonds will fall.  It hasn't happened yet though.  In fact, there remain significant worries that the Fed has been overly aggressive in raising rates (as it was around 2008).  The Brexit side effects seem to be leaning towards an easing in monetary policy rather than a tightening.<>It's important to understand that bond mutual funds, like any other investment, can experience price fluctuations and may experience declines in value. However, the magnitude of these fluctuations is typically less dramatic compared to stocks and other riskier investments. This is because bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks and other securities, and tend to be more stable in value.There are several reasons why bond mutual funds may not experience large sell-offs. One reason is that bond mutual funds typically invest in a diversified portfolio of bonds, which can help to spread risk and reduce the impact of any one bond defaulting. Additionally, the value of bonds is often less sensitive to changes in economic conditions and market conditions compared to stocks, which can also contribute to their relative stability.It's also worth noting that bond mutual funds can be an attractive option for investors who are looking to preserve capital and generate income, and may be less sensitive to short-term market movements. As such, bond mutual funds may be less likely to experience large sell-offs compared to other types of investments.It's always important for investors to carefully consider their investment goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions, and to understand the potential risks and rewards of different types of investments. It may be helpful to consult with a financial professional or to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.<>finance
