Why are interest rates on saving accounts so low in USA and Europe?<>Some comments above are inaccurate. Advertised interest rates for deposits and savings in Russia (from Russian banks) are generally for Ruble (RUB) denominated accounts; however, USD and EUR denominated accounts still offer favorable interest rates when compared to Western counterparts. For example, Sberbank advertises these Annual Interest Rates:  RUB — 8.79–11.52% USD — 2.05–5.31% EUR — 2.05–5.21%<>Interest rates on saving accounts are generally low because they are considered to be a low-risk investment. When you deposit money into a savings account, the bank uses that money to make loans to other customers, and in return, you receive a small amount of interest on your deposit. The bank takes on the risk of lending the money, so it can charge a higher interest rate on the loans it makes.Savings accounts are considered a low-risk investment because the bank is FDIC insured, which means that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will protect your deposit up to a certain amount in the event that the bank fails. Because the risk is low, the potential return on your investment (in the form of interest) is also low.Interest rates on saving accounts may also be low because of the current economic environment. When the demand for loans is low, banks may not need to offer high interest rates on savings accounts to attract deposits. In addition, central banks (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States) often set interest rates at low levels to encourage borrowing and stimulate economic growth. This can also lead to lower interest rates on saving accounts.<>finance
