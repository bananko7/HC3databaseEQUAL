What's the difference between TaxAct and TurboTax?<>Like most software it's about what you put in to them. We use ProSeries software which is like TurboTax but $4500 with no questions.   I would do your taxes on online and then have a professional do them. You then can ask any questions you may have to better understanding of what's going on. Only take copies of your documents because some unprofessional places will try to keep them.  Do this each time something big changes in your life, you have a baby, buy a house or start a business.  May cost more but could save you thousands in the long run.  I have been doing taxes professionally for 7 years.<>TaxAct and TurboTax are both software programs that can be used to prepare and file income tax returns. They both offer a variety of different options for individuals and businesses, including free and paid versions, and can be used to file federal and state tax returns.One key difference between the two is the cost. TurboTax tends to be more expensive than TaxAct, especially for its paid versions. However, TurboTax may offer more comprehensive support and a more user-friendly interface, which may be worth the extra cost for some users.Another difference is the types of users that each program targets. TurboTax is generally aimed at more mainstream users, while TaxAct is often marketed towards value-conscious consumers and small business owners. TaxAct also offers a number of tools and resources for small businesses, such as help with setting up a business, calculating tax liabilities, and managing employee payroll.Ultimately, the choice between TaxAct and TurboTax will depend on your specific needs and budget. It may be helpful to compare the features and pricing of both programs to see which one is the best fit for you.<>finance
