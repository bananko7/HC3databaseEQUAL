Stock Dividends & Splits: Are they always applied over night?<>I've never seen a dividend, split or other corporate action during the day, but I have seen trade suspended a few times when something big happened. The market opening price is not in general the same as the close of the previous day. It can gap up or down and does frequently. I don't know of an api to find out if the dividend was cash or stock, but stock dividends are a lot less common.<>Stock dividends and splits are usually applied overnight, after the market closes. This means that if you own shares of a company that is issuing a dividend or conducting a stock split, the adjustment will typically be made to your account after the market closes on the day the dividend or split is effective.For example, if a company announces that it will pay a dividend on December 31, the dividend will typically be paid to shareholders on the ex-dividend date, which is typically one or two business days before the payment date. If you own shares of the company on the ex-dividend date, you will be entitled to receive the dividend. The dividend will be paid to your brokerage account or directly to you, depending on how you have your account set up.Similarly, if a company announces that it will conduct a stock split, the split will typically be effective on a specific date, and the adjustment will be made to your account after the market closes on that date. If the company is conducting a 2-for-1 stock split, for example, you will receive an additional share for each share you own, and the price of the shares will be adjusted accordingly.It's important to note that the exact timing of dividends and stock splits can vary, so it's always a good idea to check with your brokerage or the company itself for specific details.<>finance
