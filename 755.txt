Kind of like Bluegrass vs. Country .<>Rap and hip hop are often used interchangeably, but they do have some differences. Rap is a type of music that involves singing or speaking over a beat, often in a fast and rhythmic way. It's a way for artists to tell a story, express their emotions, or share their thoughts and ideas. Hip hop is a culture that includes rap music, but it's much more than that. It's a way of life that includes music, art, dance, and fashion. Hip hop originated in the 1970s in the Bronx, New York, and has since spread around the world. It's a way for people to express themselves and their experiences, and to connect with others who have similar backgrounds or interests. So, in a way, all rap is hip hop, but not all hip hop is rap. Some people who make hip hop music might not rap at all - they might sing, play instruments, or do something else entirely. It's possible that the local rappers you're talking about are just using the term \"hip hop\" to describe their music because it's a broader and more inclusive term. They might feel that it better represents the culture and lifestyle that they're a part of. But at the same time, it's important to respect the different terms that people use to describe their music and art.<>reddit_eli5
