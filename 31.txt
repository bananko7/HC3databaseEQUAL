What causes muscle spasms, chills and deep breaths?my wife just had an attck type of muscle spasm and chills. she was basically immobilized for about 10 minutes. i wrapped her up in blankets and she started taking some deep long breaths and it subsided after 10=15 minutes. any idea what this might be?<>Hello,I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The symptoms seem to be related to a cold or flu.Chills may occur at the start of an infection. They are most often associated with a fever. Chills are caused by rapid muscle contraction and relaxation. They are the body's way of producing heat when it feels cold.So,I suggest a warm shower and anti inflammatory medications such as Acetaminophen to relieve the symptoms. Hope my answer was helpful.If you have further queries feel free to contact me again.Kind regards!

It's difficult to say what might be the specific cause without more information, but some potential causes could include:\n\nMuscle strain or injury: If your wife recently engaged in physical activity that involved repetitive or strenuous movements, it's possible that she may have strained a muscle or suffered a minor injury, which could cause muscle spasms.\n\nDehydration: Dehydration can cause muscle cramps and spasms, as well as chills and shallow breathing. If your wife has been sweating heavily or not drinking enough fluids, this could be a potential cause.\n\nFever: A fever can cause muscle aches, chills, and rapid breathing. If your wife has a fever, she may also feel tired, have a headache, or experience a loss of appetite.\n\nStress or anxiety: Stress and anxiety can cause muscle tension, which can lead to muscle spasms and cramps.
