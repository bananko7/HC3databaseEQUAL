Why do most countries have different outlet prong formats , and there is n't a universal one ? my girlfriend is going to australia tonight and she s running around trying to find the correct adaptor so it got me wondering ... Explain like I'm five.<>Electricity infrastructure was set up before international travel was cheap and easy , and before portable electronics . Electrical devices started off big and hard to move , and people did n't travel much anyway , so nobody really wanted to carry electrical things with them from country to country , and there was no real need to all use the same format .<>Different countries have different types of outlets and plugs because they use different electrical systems, which can vary in terms of the voltage and frequency of the electricity they use. The voltage is the strength of the electrical current, and the frequency is how fast the electricity alternates between positive and negative. Different countries use different voltages and frequencies, so they have developed different outlets and plugs that are compatible with their electrical systems.\n\nFor example, some countries use a voltage of 110-120 volts and a frequency of 60 Hz, while other countries use a voltage of 220-240 volts and a frequency of 50 Hz. If you try to use an appliance from one country in an outlet from another country that has a different voltage or frequency, the appliance may not work properly or may even be damaged.\n\nTherefore, it's important to use the correct adaptor when traveling to a different country to ensure that your appliances will work safely and properly.<>reddit_eli5
