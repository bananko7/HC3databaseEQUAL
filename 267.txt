In the USA, why is the Free File software only available for people earning less than $62k?<>Regardless of the source of the software (though certainly good to know), there are practical limits to the IRS 1040EZ form.  This simplified tax form is not appropriate for use once you reach a certain level of income because it only allows for the \"standard\" deduction - no itemization.   The first year I passed that level, I was panicked because I thought I suddenly owed thousands.  Switching to 1040A (aka the short form) and using even the basic itemized deductions showed that the IRS owed me a refund instead. I don't know where that level is for tax year 2015 but as you approach $62k, the simplified form is less-and-less appropriate.  It would make sense, given some of the great information in the other answers, that the free offering is only for 1040EZ.  That's certainly been true for other \"free\" software in the past.<>The Free File software is only available to people earning less than $62k per year because it is a program offered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in partnership with private tax software companies. The IRS has made this software available to taxpayers with lower incomes as a way to provide them with free access to tax preparation and filing services. The IRS has determined that this income threshold is a good way to target the program to those who are most in need of assistance with preparing and filing their taxes.It's important to note that there are other options available for taxpayers who earn more than $62k per year. Many tax software companies offer paid versions of their software that are available to all taxpayers, regardless of their income level. Additionally, taxpayers may be able to get free or low-cost assistance with preparing and filing their taxes through other programs, such as the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program or the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program.<>finance
