Why do different internet browsers perform better or worse than the other , and what makes Internet Explorer apparently terrible ? Edit : * than others , for you grammar people . Explain like I'm five.<>Most web content follows a standard set of rules , called web standards to tell the browser what the content is , and how it should look . Every browser runs on a layout engine . These are sets of code that open web addresses , render the contents , allow you to bookmark , etc . Most browsers ( Chrome and Safari , that run on the Webkit engine , and Firefox , which runs on the Gecko engine ) follow the standards pretty closely and render content the way it was intended . They also use a Javascript engine , which interprets code the web site sends to your browser to run . This uses another set of standards that browsers follow . Internet Explorer , due to Microsoft being a very proprietary company , decided that they would create their own proprietary standards , and web content would need to conform to them to look good in their browser . So for a long time there was a set of rules for good browsers , and a set of rules for IE . So basically everyone hated IE for making them maintain two sets of code . Also , their were looooots of bugs in earlier versions of IE , where , even if you followed the rules , things would be rendered incorrectly , frustrating developers even more .<>Different internet browsers perform differently because they use different underlying technology and have different features. Some people may prefer one browser over another because it has features that they like, or because it works better on their particular device or operating system. As for Internet Explorer, it was once a very popular browser, but it has not been updated as frequently as some other browsers, so it may not have as many new features or work as well on some newer websites.<>reddit_eli5
