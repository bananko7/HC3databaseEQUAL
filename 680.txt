How do nuclear weapons work ? More specifically , how does the impact of the bomb \/ missile correlate to the release of the payload ? What â€™s the process from impact to result ? Explain like I'm five. <>It 's not triggered by an impact . Nuclear weapons are detonated kilometers up in the air by using a smaller detonation to force a neutron to hit an unstable atom . This atom will under go fission , releasing more neutrons that hit more unstable atoms that in turn release more neutrons that in turn release more neutrons that in turn ... You get the idea . It 's the same idea as in a nuclear reactor just that you do n't control it .<>Nuclear weapons work by using the energy released from the splitting of atoms, a process called nuclear fission, to create a huge explosion. When a missile or bomb carrying a nuclear weapon hits its target, the nuclear material inside the weapon is designed to explode, releasing a massive amount of energy in the form of a shockwave, heat, and radiation.\\n\\nThe process of releasing the energy from a nuclear weapon begins when the missile or bomb hits its target and the nuclear material inside is ignited. This ignition can be caused by a variety of methods, such as a timing device, a impact or pressure sensor, or a remote signal.\\n\\nOnce the nuclear material is ignited, it begins to split, or fission, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. This energy is what causes the explosion and the resulting damage. The size of the explosion depends on the amount of nuclear material used and the design of the weapon.\\n\\nIt's important to note that nuclear weapons are extremely powerful and can cause widespread destruction and loss of life. They should only be used as a last resort in situations of extreme conflict.<>reddit_eli5
