Please explain what is \"Punched card\"<>A punched card (also punch card or punched-card) is a piece of stiff paper that holds digital data represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. Punched cards were once common in data processing applications or to directly control automated machinery.\nPunched cards were widely used through much of the 20th century in the data processing industry, where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines, organized into semiautomatic data processing systems, used punched cards for data input, output, and storage.  The IBM 12-row\/80-column punched card format came to dominate the industry. Many early digital computers used punched cards as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.\nWhile punched cards are now obsolete as a storage medium, as of 2012, some voting machines still used punched cards to record votes. They also had a significant cultural impact.<>A punched card, also known as a Hollerith card or IBM card, is a piece of stiff paper that was used as a medium for storing and manipulating data in the early days of computing. It is called a \"punched\" card because it has a series of small holes punched into it in a standardized pattern. Each hole represents a specific character or piece of data, and the pattern of holes encodes the information stored on the card.\n\n\n\nPunched cards were widely used from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century in a variety of applications, including data processing, telecommunication, and manufacturing. They were particularly popular in the early days of electronic computers, when they were used as a way to input and output data, as well as to store programs and data.\n\n\n\nPunched cards were eventually replaced by more modern technologies, such as magnetic tape and disk storage, which offered greater capacity and flexibility. However, they remain an important part of the history of computing and continue to be used in some niche applications to this day.<>wiki_csai
