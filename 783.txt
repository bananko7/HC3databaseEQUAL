who pulmonary hypertension<>It was first identified by Dr. Ernst von Romberg in 1891.<>Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. It is a serious and often life-threatening condition that can lead to heart failure if left untreated.\\n\\nSymptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and dizziness. The cause of pulmonary hypertension is often unknown, but it can be caused by a variety of factors including underlying lung conditions, certain medications, and other medical conditions such as heart disease or sickle cell anemia.\\n\\nTreatment for pulmonary hypertension may include medications, oxygen therapy, and lifestyle changes.

This can cause the right side of the heart to work harder to pump blood through the lungs, which can eventually lead to heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension can be caused by a variety of factors, including underlying lung conditions such as COPD, sleep apnea, and asthma; certain medications; and certain genetic conditions. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and chest pain. Treatment for pulmonary hypertension may include medications to improve blood flow through the lungs and to reduce the workload on the heart, as well as lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and engaging in regular physical activity. In severe cases, a heart-lung transplant may be necessary.","Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs is elevated. It is a serious and often life-threatening condition that can lead to heart failure and other complications. The exact cause of pulmonary hypertension is often unknown, but it can be caused by various factors, including certain medical conditions (such as lung diseases, heart defects, and blood disorders), exposure to certain medications or substances, and underlying genetic factors. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and lightheadedness. Treatment for pulmonary hypertension may involve medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgery.
