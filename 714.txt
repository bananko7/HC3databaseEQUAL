Please explain what is \"Situation calculus\"<>The situation calculus is a logic formalism designed for representing and reasoning about dynamical domains. It was first introduced by John McCarthy in 1963. The main version of the situational calculus that is presented in this article is based on that introduced by Ray Reiter in 1991. It is followed by sections about McCarthy's 1986 version and a logic programming formulation.<>Situation calculus is a formalism for representing and reasoning about actions and change in a domain. It is a type of first-order logic that is specifically designed for representing and reasoning about actions and their effects.\n\n\n\nIn situation calculus, a situation is a snapshot of the world at a particular point in time. Situations are represented using predicates and variables, and are used to describe the state of the world and the objects within it. For example, a situation might include predicates such as \"the cat is on the mat\" or \"the door is open.\"\n\n\n\nActions are represented using functions that take a situation as input and produce a new situation as output. For example, an action might be represented as a function that takes a situation where the cat is on the mat and produces a new situation where the cat is no longer on the mat.\n\n\n\nReasoning in situation calculus involves making inferences about what will happen as a result of performing different actions in different situations. This can be done using logical rules that describe how actions affect the state of the world and the objects within it.\n\n\n\nSituation calculus is often used in artificial intelligence and automated planning systems, where it can be used to represent and reason about the actions that an agent can take in order to achieve its goals. It is also used in other fields, such as philosophy and linguistics, where it can be used to represent and reason about the meaning and effects of different actions.<>wiki_csai
