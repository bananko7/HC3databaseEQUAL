Things I should know about when owning a credit card . Stuff like APR , any vocabulary associated with the credit card and etc . I have a Bank of America Credit Card if anyone is wondering . Explain like I'm five.<>First and foremost : Understand how they change interest . Most credit cards have a grace period after each purchase to pay it off without incurring interest charges . It 's usually in the neighborhood of 25 days . This is from the date of * purchase * not your billing day . If you buy something on September 1st , get a bill on September 20th , and pay it on the 26th , you 're going to get charged based on your APR is on the purchase ( and for the entire time , just just since the end of the grace period ) . APR is a bit complicated , but it basically determines how much you 'll pay in interest on a purchase once the grace period expires . It 's not a straight - up charge , but instead they determine a daily rate based on your annual rate and charge interest per day . The easiest way to visualize it and get an idea is to play around with a few numbers and see how it ends up . There 's a calculator [ here ] ( URL_0 ) ( Put 0 for extra cost ) . If you 're new to credit , you 'll probably get an APR in the 15 % range . 9 % is incredibly good for new credit folks and with perfect credit and payment history you can usually snag APRs as low as 3 % or so . Once you mess up though ( late payment , returned check ) it usually get jacked up to the 30 % range . As far as using it wisely and staying away from interest : Do n't spend any money you wo n't have in the next 30 days to pay it off . If you want to do something like buy something more expensive now instead of saving up , use a calculator ( like the one above ) to figure out exactly how much you 'll be paying before you decide if it 's worth it . I 've lived paycheck - to - paycheck before and used credit cards to \" float \" payments until my next paycheck if they were due before . Also , do n't keep your card near the max . Pay it off as soon as you can because it 's nice to have an emergency cushion and it beats trying to borrow money from friends \/ family or getting one of those satanic payday loans .<>Sure! Here are some important things to know when you have a credit card:\r\n\r\nAPR: This stands for Annual Percentage Rate, and it's the amount of interest that you'll be charged on any unpaid balances on your credit card. The higher your APR, the more you'll pay in interest.\r\n\r\nCredit limit: This is the maximum amount of money that you're allowed to borrow on your credit card. If you reach your credit limit, you won't be able to make any more purchases until you pay off some of the balance.\r\n\r\nMinimum payment: This is the smallest amount of money that you must pay each month to keep your credit card account in good standing. If you only pay the minimum payment, it will take you longer to pay off your credit card balance and you'll end up paying more in interest.\r\n\r\nBalance: This is the total amount of money that you owe on your credit card. You can see your balance by looking at your monthly credit card statement or by logging into your online account.\r\n\r\nRewards: Some credit cards offer rewards programs where you can earn points, miles, or cash back for making purchases with your credit card. These rewards can be redeemed for things like travel, merchandise, or statement credits.\r\n\r\nIt's important to be responsible with your credit card and to pay your bills on time. If you have any questions about your credit card, you can always reach out to your credit card issuer or bank for more information.<>reddit_eli5
