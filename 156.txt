Are you able to manage your intrusive thoughts? Are the thoughts affecting your day to day activities adversely? If yes, you need to go for cognitive therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. K. V. Anand, Psychologist<>Intrusive thoughts are a common experience, and it is normal to have them from time to time. However, if you are having intrusive thoughts frequently and they are causing you distress or interfering with your daily life, it is possible that you may be experiencing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or another mental health condition.\n\nOCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is characterized by repetitive and distressing thoughts, images, or urges (called obsessions) and behaviors or mental acts (called compulsions) that an individual feels driven to perform in response to these obsessions. Obsessions and compulsions can take many forms and can vary from person to person.\n\nIt is important to note that having intrusive thoughts does not necessarily mean that you have OCD or any other mental health condition. However, if you are concerned about your thoughts or are experiencing significant distress, it is important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can assess your symptoms and provide you with a diagnosis and treatment plan if necessary.<>medicine
