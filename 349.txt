Please explain what is \"Probability density function\"<>In probability theory, a probability density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would be close to that sample. Probability density  is the  probability per unit length,  in other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.\nIn a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable's PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the entire curve is equal to 1.\nThe terms \"probability distribution function\" and \"probability function\" have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, \"probability distribution function\" may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function, or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. \"Density function\" itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion. In general though, the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables.<>A probability density function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the probability of an event occurring within a certain range of values. It is a continuous function, meaning that it can take on any value within a certain range, as opposed to a discrete function, which can only take on specific, discrete values.\n\n\n\nThe probability density function is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It is defined such that the total area under the curve of the function is equal to 1, which represents the total probability of all possible outcomes. The probability of a specific range of values occurring is equal to the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a continuous random variable X that has a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. The PDF of this random variable is given by the following equation:\n\n\n\nf(x) = (1 \/ (σ * √(2π))) * e^-(((x - μ)^2) \/ (2σ^2))\n\n\n\nThis function describes the probability of X taking on any value within a certain range. The probability of X taking on a specific value is technically zero, since X is a continuous variable and can take on an infinite number of values within a certain range. However, the probability of X taking on a value within a certain range can be calculated by finding the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.\n\n\n\nIn general, the probability density function is a useful tool for understanding the probability distribution of a continuous random variable and for making statistical inferences about the variable.<>wiki_csai
