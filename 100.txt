How does the hubble telescope take pictures of our own galaxy ? If it is orbiting earth , how does it take pictures of the milky way ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The same way you can take a picture of your living room from your couch . It 's incomplete , but still informative .<>The Hubble Space Telescope is a telescope that is launched into space and orbits around Earth. It has a special camera called a \"Wide Field Camera 3\" that takes very detailed pictures of objects in space, including the Milky Way galaxy. \nThe Milky Way is a large group of stars, gas, and dust that is shaped like a disk. It is the galaxy that Earth and the rest of our solar system are a part of. The Hubble Space Telescope takes pictures of the Milky Way by pointing its camera at different parts of the galaxy and taking long exposures, which means it takes a picture for a longer amount of time. This helps the camera capture a lot of light from the stars and other objects in the galaxy, which makes the picture very detailed and clear. \nThe Hubble Space Telescope is able to take pictures of the Milky Way from its orbit around Earth because it is far away from the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere can make it difficult to see objects in space clearly, because it can cause the light from those objects to become distorted. But the Hubble Space Telescope is above the Earth's atmosphere, so it can see objects in space much more clearly. This is why it is able to take such detailed pictures of the Milky Way and other objects in space.<>reddit_eli5
