What is the best asset allocation for a retirement portfolio, and why?<>Take the easy approach - as suggested by John Bogle (founder of Vanguard - and a man worthy of tremendous respect). Two portfolios consisting of 1 index fund each. Invest your age% in the Fixed Income index fund. Invest (1-age)% in the stock index fund.  Examples of these funds are the Total Market Index Fund (VTSMX) and the Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX). If you wish to be slightly more adventurous, blend (1-age-10)% as the Total Market Index Fund and a fixed 10% as Total International Stock Index (VGTSX).  You will sleep well at night for most of your life.<>The best asset allocation for a retirement portfolio will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It is important to consider a variety of factors, including your age, the number of years until you retire, your expected retirement income needs, and your ability to tolerate market volatility.In general, as you approach retirement, it is typically recommended to shift your portfolio to a more conservative asset allocation, with a greater emphasis on income-generating assets such as bonds and dividend-paying stocks. This can help to provide a more stable and consistent stream of income during retirement, while also helping to preserve capital.It is also important to diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, to help manage risk and potentially improve returns over the long term. Diversification can help to reduce the impact of market volatility on your portfolio, as well as protect against the risk of losing money in any one particular asset class.It is worth noting that asset allocation does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss. It is important to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it continues to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. It is also a good idea to seek the advice of a financial professional who can help you develop an appropriate asset allocation strategy for your retirement portfolio.<>finance
