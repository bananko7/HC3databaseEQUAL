Why does hot water make better ice cubes ? I noticed a while back that room temperature water made better ice cubes than cold water and if I waited a little bit for the water to get hot they were even better . Why ? Explain like I'm five.<>Since gasses do n't stay dissolved as well in warmer water , there would be less air held in the water . Freezing that would give you ice that is much more clear , as there would be fewer air bubbles in the cubes .<>Hot water actually doesn't make better ice cubes. The key to making good ice cubes is using clean, filtered water and allowing the ice to freeze slowly in the freezer.\n\nWhen you use hot water to make ice cubes, the hot water can cause the ice cube tray to expand, which can cause the ice cubes to come out misshapen. Additionally, hot water will melt some of the ice as it freezes, which can result in cloudy, opaque ice cubes.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use room temperature or cold water and allow the ice cubes to freeze slowly in the freezer, the water will freeze more evenly and the ice cubes will come out clear and solid.\n\nSo, the best way to make good ice cubes is to use cold or room temperature water and be patient while the ice freezes. Don't use hot water, and don't try to rush the freezing process by placing the ice cube tray in the freezer with the water already in it.<>reddit_eli5
