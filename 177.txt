What are “trailing 12-month total returns”?<>Total Return is the percent change in value (including andy dividends) of an instrument.  The \"trailing 12-month\" means that your starting point is the value 12 months ago.  So the formula is: where V is the value of the instrument on the reference date, V0 is the value of the instrument 12 months prior to the reference date, and D is the amount of dividends paid between the two dates.<>Trailing 12-month total returns represent the percentage change in the value of an investment over the past 12 months, including any dividends or interest earned. This measure is often used to assess the performance of an investment or a portfolio over a longer period of time. It is calculated by taking the total return over the past 12 months and dividing it by the value of the investment at the beginning of that period. The resulting percentage represents the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the investment over the trailing 12-month period.","Trailing 12-month total returns, or TTM returns, are the returns of an investment over the past 12 months. This measure is used to give an idea of how an investment has performed over a longer period of time, rather than just looking at its performance over a short period such as the past month or week. TTM returns are often used to assess the performance of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other types of investment products. To calculate TTM returns, you would take the current price of the investment and subtract the price from one year ago, then divide that number by the price from one year ago. The result is expressed as a percentage. For example, if an investment has a TTM return of 10%, it means that it has gained 10% in value over the past 12 months.<>finance
