Please explain what is \"Paper tape\"<>Punched tape or perforated paper tape is a form of data storage that consists of a long strip of paper in which holes are punched. It developed from and was subsequently used alongside punched cards, differing in that the tape is continuous.\nPunched cards, and chains of punched cards, were used for control of looms in the 18th century. Use for telegraphy systems started in 1842. Punched tape was used throughout the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries for programmable looms, teleprinter communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for minicomputers and CNC machine tools. During the Second World War, high-speed punched tape systems using optical readout methods were used in code breaking systems. Punched tape was used to transmit data for manufacture of read-only memory chips.<>Paper tape is a medium for storing and transmitting data, consisting of a long strip of paper with holes punched into it in a specific pattern. It was used primarily in the mid-20th century for data entry and storage on computers, as well as for control functions in manufacturing and other industries.\n\n\n\nPaper tape was a common method of input for computers before the widespread use of keyboards. Data was entered onto the paper tape using a punch, which made holes in the tape according to a specific code. The punched tape could then be read by a machine, such as a computer or a loom, which would interpret the pattern of holes and carry out the corresponding actions.\n\n\n\nPaper tape had several advantages over other methods of data storage and transmission. It was relatively cheap, durable, and easy to use, and it could be easily edited by hand. However, it was also relatively slow and inflexible, and it has been largely replaced by other methods such as magnetic tapes and disks.<>wiki_csai
