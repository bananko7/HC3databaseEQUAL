Why should one only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k)?<>If you exceed the income limit for deducting a traditional IRA (which is very low if you are covered by a 401(k) ), then your IRA options are basically limited to a Roth IRA. The Cramer person probably meant to compare 401(k) and IRA from the same pre-\/post-tax-ness, so i.e. Traditional 401(k) vs. Traditional IRA, or Roth 401(k) vs. Roth IRA. Comparing a Roth investment against a Traditional investment goes into a whole other topic that only confuses what is being discussed here. So if deducting a traditional IRA is ruled out, then I don't think Cramer's advice can be as simply applied regarding a Traditional 401(k). (However, by that logic, and since most people on 401(k) have Traditional 401(k), and if you are covered by a 401(k) then you cannot deduct a Traditional IRA unless you are super low income, that would mean Cramer's advice is not applicable in most situations. So I don't really know what to think here.)<>It is generally a good idea to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. For example, if your employer offers a 50% match on the first 6% of your salary that you contribute to your 401(k), and you contribute 6% of your salary, your employer will contribute an additional 3% (50% of your contribution). If you contribute more than the employer match, you may be able to save more for retirement, but this will depend on your individual financial situation and goals.There are several factors to consider when deciding how much to contribute to your 401(k). These include your current financial situation, your retirement savings goals, your potential future income and expenses, and your overall financial plan. It is a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional to help you determine the right contribution level for your individual circumstances.<>finance
