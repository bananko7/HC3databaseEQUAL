Based on your symptoms the possibilities are I would have been able to further narrow down the differential if I had seen the photos. Do not burst those blisters with anything, apply Betadine ointment (Povidone-iodine) over the burst ones and you can start tablet Clindatec 300 mg (Clindamycin) twice daily in the morning and night for seven days antibiotic to prevent infection.

However, based on the description you provided, it is possible that you may be experiencing a condition called herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is a viral infection that can cause small, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, often in clusters. These blisters may be painful and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nIf you are experiencing these symptoms, it is important to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try to relieve your symptoms by taking over-the-counter pain medication and keeping the affected area clean and dry. Avoid touching or scratching the blisters to prevent them from spreading.\n\nIt is also possible that the symptoms you are experiencing could be caused by another skin condition, such as impetigo or folliculitis. Again, it is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.<>medicine
