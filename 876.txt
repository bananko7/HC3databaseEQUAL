Suggest treatment for small blood clots in the lungsI just got discharged today I had a DVT and they also found small clots in my lungs and signs of past small clots that have gone through my lungs. I smoke marijuana and was wondering if it would be a bad to try to use marijuana as a pain killer instead of percocets at this point?<>Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. You should not use marijuana as painkiller. Marijuana smoking is known cause of DVT (deep venous thrombosis) and Pulmonary embolism. So better not to start marijuana smoking again. This will worsen your condition. You need to take blood thinner medicines for atleast 6-8 months to dissolve blood clots. Avoid broccoli and other food which are rich source of vitamin K. So start blood thinner medicines and continue on it. Avoid marijuana smoking. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.<>It is not recommended to use marijuana as a treatment for blood clots in the lungs. Blood clots in the lungs, also known as pulmonary embolisms, can be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Treatment usually involves anticoagulant medications, which help to prevent new clots from forming and allow existing clots to dissolve. In some cases, other treatments such as thrombolytics (medications that break up blood clots) or mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure that removes blood clots using specialized equipment) may be necessary.\n\nIt is important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for treatment and to take all prescribed medications as directed. It is also important to follow a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking and avoiding substances that could increase your risk of blood clots or interfere with your treatment. If you are currently using marijuana, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider to determine whether it is safe for you to continue doing so.<>medicine
