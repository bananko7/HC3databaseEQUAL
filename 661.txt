They are popable and look like little pimples w\/o any white inside them....what coul this be? Does this occur before armpit hair begins to grow?<>Hi,It sees that there might be having enlarged axillary lymphnodes producing bumps in that area.This can be due to having some recurrent minor injuries on hand, fingers.Nothing to worry if there is no pain or size increases.Ok and take care.<>There are a few different things that can cause bumps and swelling under the armpit. Some possible causes include:\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa: This is a condition that causes small, painful bumps to form under the armpit or in other areas where there are a lot of sweat glands, such as the groin or buttocks. These bumps can become infected and may need to be treated with antibiotics.\n\nFolliculitis: This is an infection of the hair follicles that can cause red, swollen bumps to form under the armpit. It is usually caused by bacteria and can be treated with antibiotics or other medications.\n\nIngrown hairs: These are hairs that have curled back into the skin instead of growing outwards. They can cause red, swollen bumps to form under the armpit.\n\nCysts: These are small, fluid-filled bumps that can form under the skin. They can be caused by a variety of things, including blocked sweat glands or hair follicles.\n\nIt's not uncommon for bumps and swelling to occur under the armpit before armpit hair begins to grow. If your son is experiencing these symptoms and they are causing him discomfort or concern, it's a good idea to have a healthcare provider take a look. They can help determine the cause of the bumps and recommend appropriate treatment.<>medicine
