Please explain what is \"Herbert A. Simon\"<>Herbert Alexander Simon (June 15, 1916 – February 9, 2001) was an American political scientist, with a Ph.D. in political science, whose work also influenced the fields of computer science, economics, and cognitive psychology. His primary research interest was decision-making within organizations and he is best known for the theories of \"bounded rationality\" and \"satisficing\". He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1978 and the Turing Award in computer science in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001,[10] where he helped found the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, one of the first such departments in the world.\nNotably, Simon was among the pioneers of several modern-day scientific domains such as artificial intelligence, information processing, decision-making, problem-solving, organization theory, and complex systems. He was among the earliest to analyze the architecture of complexity and to propose a preferential attachment mechanism to explain power law distributions.[11][12]<>Herbert Alexander Simon (1916-2001) was an American economist and political scientist who made important contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence, decision-making, and organizational behavior. He is best known for his work on decision-making and problem-solving, which he explored through the development of computer models of human cognition.\n\n\n\nSimon was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and received his undergraduate degree in political science from the University of Chicago. He went on to earn his PhD in economics from the same institution, where he studied under economist Milton Friedman. After completing his studies, Simon became a faculty member at the Carnegie Mellon University, where he spent the majority of his career.\n\n\n\nSimon was a highly influential figure in the field of artificial intelligence and was instrumental in the development of the discipline. He was a pioneer in the use of computer simulations to study human cognition and decision-making processes, and his work helped to establish the foundations of modern AI research.\n\n\n\nIn 1978, Simon was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his contributions to the study of decision-making and problem-solving in economic organizations. He continued to be an active researcher and writer until his death in 2001, and his work continues to be highly influential in the field of AI and cognitive science.<>wiki_csai
