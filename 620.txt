When soldiers in the civil war would line up and fire point blank into each others faces ... What was the purpose of this ? i mean , was there one ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Contrary to what many people are saying guns in the Civil War were way , way more accurate than the guns your average solders was using 20 years before the civil war . The problem was that they were still using black powder . Because of the range and power of [ rifled muskets ] ( URL_1 ) meant that the first couple of volleys could be catastrophic for the guys on the receiving end but soon after that there was so much smoke on the battle field that it would be hard to even see the enemy until they were very close . That being said , [ Napoleonic tactics ] ( URL_0 ) where much more common in the beginning stages of the Civil War than they were towards the end . Early forms of trench warfare were widely used during the later parts of the war although attackers where not as vulnerable as they were during WWI .<>The purpose of this type of tactic, called a \"volley,\" was to try to kill as many enemy soldiers as possible in a short amount of time. During the Civil War, soldiers would often line up in rows, with one row firing their weapons at the enemy while the other rows reloaded their guns. When the first row had finished firing, they would drop to the ground and the next row would stand up and fire. This allowed the soldiers to keep firing without having to pause to reload their guns. The goal was to overwhelm the enemy with a constant barrage of gunfire. \nIt was a very dangerous tactic because the soldiers were often very close to the enemy when they fired, and they were also exposed to enemy fire. Many soldiers were killed or injured during volleys. Despite the risks, both Union and Confederate soldiers used this tactic during the Civil War.<>reddit_eli5
