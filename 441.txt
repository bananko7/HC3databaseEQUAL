It seems like it has gotten worse. its a throbbing and burning pain and in the morning it is very hard to walk on and it is swollen. it hurts to walk. I was just wondering what it might be.<>Hi, It can be ankle sprain most probably developed due to trivial trauma or slipping. As the first line of management, you can take analgesics like Diclofenac for pain relief. Apply ice packs also. If pain persists, better to consult an orthopedician and get an MRI scan done. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
