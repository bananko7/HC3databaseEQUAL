Why Do We Call A Spouse 's Family by Brother In - Law , Mother In - Law , etc ? I.e. it would seem strange to call your wife 's brother , your brother . , almost meaning your wife is your sister . Explain like I'm five. <>Because they are now legally ( in law ) your family member . So while they 're not blood related , they are related \" in law \" .<>When you marry someone, their family becomes a part of your family too. But since you're not actually related to them by blood, we have special terms to describe your relationship with them. For example, your spouse's brother is not actually your brother, but he is still a part of your family because he is related to your spouse. So we call him your \"brother-in-law.\" The same goes for your spouse's mother and father, who are your \"mother-in-law\" and \"father-in-law.\" These terms help us keep track of the relationships within our extended families and show that these people are important to us, even though they are not directly related to us by blood.<>reddit_eli5
