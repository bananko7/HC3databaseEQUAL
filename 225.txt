What is i and how does i^2 = -1 ? i^2 = -1 ? How can the square of anything be -1 ? Explain like I'm five.<>Why is i^2 = -1 ? Because that is exactly how we define i ! Your second question is more interesting . When your start working with squares , it is n't long before you realize that the square of any number is always a positive number . The question that follows is , then what happens when you take the square root of a negative number ? Well nothing happens , the square root of a negative number just does n't exist . Then some old random greek dude said , imagine , there is some number i whose square is -1 .. Now suddenly we have a way to express the square root of every negative number ! square root of -25 is 5i . It turns out that the ability to express the square roots of negative numbers has very useful applications in engineering so we adopted i and kept it . But it still remains that i has no clear significance when counting . for instance if I had i apples , what does it even mean ? ! For a long time , it was considered quite pointless and hence the name imaginary numbers as opposed to the other * real * numbers .<>In mathematics, the letter \"i\" is used to represent the square root of -1. This might seem strange because the square of a number is always positive, and the square root of a number is always positive. However, when we square the number \"i,\" we get a result of -1.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe square of a number is that number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 2 is 2 * 2 = 4. The square of 3 is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nThe square root of a number is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives us the original number. For example, the square root of 4 is 2, because 2 * 2 = 4. The square root of 9 is 3, because 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nNow, let's think about the square root of -1. We can't just multiply -1 by itself and get -1, because (-1) * (-1) = 1, not -1. However, we can use the letter \"i\" to represent the square root of -1.\n\nSo, if we square the number \"i,\" we get \"i\" * \"i\" = -1.\n\nI hope that helps to explain it! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
