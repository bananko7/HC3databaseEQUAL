Can i safely go on amusement park rides with an EF of 40?Hi I am a breast cancer patient, I am currently on Herceptin (I finished 20 rounds of taxol\/herceptin then AC). The herceptin has caused my ejection factor to drop to 40, I am currently on meds to increase it so i can resume the herceptin. Can I safely go on amusement park rides with an ef of 40?<>yes u can. But though EF is moderate but u have higher chance of cardiac arrhythmia even at at rest. but u should be aware about the higher chance of arrhythmias. ur EF will mainly improve with holiday time from Perception if it was normal before t\/t. you should not get another dose until ur EF improves.<>It is generally not recommended for individuals with a low ejection fraction (EF) to go on amusement park rides. The EF is a measure of how well the heart is pumping blood, and a low EF can indicate that the heart is not functioning as well as it should be. Amusement park rides can be physically strenuous and may place additional stress on the heart, which could be harmful for someone with a low EF.\n\nIt is important to speak with your healthcare provider about your specific situation and get their advice before engaging in any physically strenuous activities, including amusement park rides. They will be able to assess your overall health and advise you on what activities are safe for you to participate in based on your medical history and current condition.<>medicine
