Please explain what is \"AI applications\"<>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications to alleviate certain problems throughout industry and academia. AI, like electricity or computers, is a general purpose technology that has a multitude of applications. It has been used in fields of language translation, image recognition, credit scoring, e-commerce and other domains.<>AI applications are computer systems that are designed to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, learning, and making decisions. These tasks are often referred to as \"cognitive computing\" or \"artificial intelligence\" (AI). AI applications can be classified into two broad categories: narrow or general. Narrow AI applications are designed to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation, whereas general AI applications are designed to perform a wide range of tasks and have the ability to learn and adapt as they encounter new situations.\n\n\n\nSome examples of AI applications include:\n\n\n\nNatural language processing (NLP): This involves the ability of a computer to understand and interpret human language, such as speech or text.\n\n\n\nMachine learning: This involves the ability of a computer to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.\n\n\n\nRobotics: This involves the use of AI to control and coordinate the movement of robots.\n\n\n\nComputer vision: This involves the ability of a computer to recognize and interpret visual data, such as images and video.\n\n\n\nExpert systems: This involves the use of AI to replicate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific field.\n\n\n\nAI applications have the potential to revolutionize many industries and are being used in a variety of applications, including healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and more. However, the development and use of AI also raise ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for job displacement and the need for responsible use of the technology.<>wiki_csai
