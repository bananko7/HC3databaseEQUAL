Why is good quality toilet paper so expensive ? I just do n't get it . Please explain like I'm five.<>i use the cheapest possible , i m one of the rare people in europe who still mainly use water to wash the butt , it cleans much better than toilet paper<>Toilet paper is made from pulp, which is a type of soft, absorbent material that is made from wood fibers. To make high-quality toilet paper, manufacturers often use long, strong fibers from trees like pine or spruce, which can be more expensive than other types of wood. In addition, the process of turning these fibers into toilet paper requires a lot of energy and water, which can also add to the cost.Toilet paper is also a product that we use every day, and people generally expect it to be soft, strong, and absorbent. This means that manufacturers have to put a lot of effort into making sure their toilet paper meets these high standards, which can also add to the cost.Finally, toilet paper is something that we all need, so manufacturers can charge more for it because people will still buy it even if it's a little bit more expensive. This is called \"demand\" - if there is a lot of demand for a product, manufacturers can charge more for it.I hope that helps to explain why toilet paper can be expensive! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
