However, it is important to monitor your symptoms and speak to your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.\n\nIf you have noticed a decrease in fetal movement, it is important to contact your healthcare provider right away. Decreased fetal movement can be a sign of a problem and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.\n\nIt is also important to monitor your blood pressure during pregnancy. High blood pressure can be a sign of preeclampsia, which is a serious condition that can affect both the mother and the baby. If you are concerned about your blood pressure or any other symptoms, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider. They will be able to assess your symptoms and provide you with appropriate care.<>medicine
