This could be due to an infection or to many other causes. The inflammatory process and the change in ESR could be due to the infection and would occur regardless of antibiotic treatment- it is part of the body's response to the infection. If the infection clears up with treatment, the inflammatory process will start to clear up, but signs of it such as the ESR may take some time to return to normal. The ESR is not useful for following the course of an infection. Again, it may also be due to an entirely different condition from the infection, such as arthritis, lupus, response to injuries, etc etc. Hope this helps.<>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that measures the rate at which red blood cells (erythrocytes) sediment in a tube over a period of time. It is not a specific test for any particular disease, but it can be elevated in a variety of conditions, including infections, inflammation, and certain types of cancer. It is not uncommon for ESR to increase slightly in response to an infection, as the body's immune system responds to the infection by releasing substances that can cause inflammation.\n\nThere are several reasons why ESR may increase after starting antibiotics:\n\nThe infection is causing inflammation: As mentioned above, ESR can be elevated in response to inflammation, and infections can often cause inflammation. If the infection is causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as the body's immune system responds to the infection.\n\nThe antibiotics are causing inflammation: Some antibiotics can cause inflammation as a side effect. This is not a common side effect, but it is possible. If the antibiotics you are taking are causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as a result.\n\nThe infection is not responding to the antibiotics: If the infection is not responding to the antibiotics, then ESR may continue to increase despite treatment. This could be due to a number of factors, such as antibiotic resistance or an underlying condition that is making it difficult for the antibiotics to work effectively.\n\nIt is important to note that ESR is not a specific test for infection, and the presence of an infection does not necessarily mean that ESR will be elevated. Similarly, an increase in ESR does not necessarily mean that an infection is present. It is important to discuss any concerns or questions you have about your ESR with your healthcare provider. They can help interpret the results of your ESR test and determine the best course of treatment based on your individual situation.<>medicine
