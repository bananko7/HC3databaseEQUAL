when was the web invented<>Using concepts from his earlier hypertext systems like ENQUIRE , British engineer, computer scientist and at that time employee of the CERN , Sir Tim Berners-Lee , now Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), wrote a proposal in March 1989 for what would eventually become the World Wide Web.<>The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while he was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland. He proposed the idea of the Web as a way to share information among researchers at CERN, and he wrote the first web browser and server software to make it possible to access and publish information on the Web. The Web has since become a vast and essential part of modern life, with billions of people around the world using it for communication, entertainment, education, and business.","The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while he was working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. He developed the first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, and wrote the first version of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of the modern web. He also designed the first web server, called CERN httpd. Sir Tim Berners-Lee's goal was to create a system that would allow scientists at different institutions to share information and collaborate more easily, and the web has since grown to become a global phenomenon, with billions of users around the world accessing it on a daily basis.","The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while he was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Berners-Lee is credited with developing the first web browser and the basic protocols and technologies that make the World Wide Web possible. He released the first version of the web browser, called WorldWideWeb, in 1990. The World Wide Web has since become an integral part of modern life and is used by billions of people around the world to access information and communicate with one another.<>open_qa
