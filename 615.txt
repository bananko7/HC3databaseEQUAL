What is \" Theory of Mind \" # # ELI5 : What is \" Theory of Mind \" I am reading a book about animal behavior and stumbled on the expression \" Theory of Mind \" , which I can not really understand . Explain like I'm five. <>[ Theory of mind ] ( URL_0 ) basically means that you understand that other individuals have their own experiences , beliefs , and perspectives . As an example , before children fully develop a theory of mind , they do n't understand that other people do n't see the world exactly , and I do mean * * exactly * * , as they do . Have you ever seen a child cover their eyes and claim that no one can see them ? This is because they do n't comprehend that other people see the world through a point of view that 's not theirs . To them , it 's plainly obvious that if they ca n't see something , no one else can , either . Another example is a psychological test where the researcher pantomimes a doll placing some object in a box . The doll then goes away , and a different doll moves the object out of the box and hides it under a blanket . The researcher then asks the child where the first doll will look for the object when they come back . Before developing a theory of mind , children say that the doll will look under the blanket . When asked why the doll would look there , they typically answer , \" Because that 's where it is . \" They think that their point of view is * * the * * point of view . If they know something , everyone else must know it , too .<>The theory of mind is the ability to understand that other people have their own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that may be different from our own. It's the understanding that other people are not just robots or objects, but have their own mental states that influence their behavior.\\n\\nFor example, if you see a person crying, you might understand that they are feeling sad because they have experienced something upsetting. This is because you have a theory of mind - you understand that the person has their own thoughts and feelings, and that these thoughts and feelings can be different from your own.\\n\\nIn contrast, if you don't have a theory of mind, you might see the person crying and think they are just making a strange noise or behaving oddly, without understanding that they are expressing a particular emotion.\\n\\nThe theory of mind is an important aspect of human social interaction and is considered a key component of empathy and perspective-taking. It is typically developed in children around the age of 4 or 5, and is considered an important part of cognitive development.<>reddit_eli5
