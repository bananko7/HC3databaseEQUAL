How does a bank make money on an interest free secured loan?<>Very good answers as to how 0% loans are typically done.  In addition, many are either tied to a specific large item purchase, or credit cards with a no interest period.  On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee.  In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale.  They will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal, or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates, but you don't get both.<>Banks typically make money on loans by charging interest on the amount borrowed. An interest-free loan would not generate any income for the bank from the interest payments. However, there are other ways that banks can make money on an interest-free secured loan.One way is by requiring the borrower to pay fees for the loan, such as origination fees or closing costs. These fees can help offset the cost of providing the loan and can contribute to the bank's profitability.Another way is by using the loan as a way to attract deposits or other business from the borrower. For example, the bank may offer an interest-free loan as a way to encourage the borrower to open a checking or savings account with the bank, or to use other financial products or services offered by the bank. The bank can then make money from these other sources of business.Finally, the bank may make money on the loan by earning a profit on the sale of the assets that were used as collateral for the loan. For example, if the borrower used a piece of property as collateral for the loan and defaulted on the loan, the bank could sell the property and use the proceeds to pay off the loan and potentially earn a profit.<>finance
