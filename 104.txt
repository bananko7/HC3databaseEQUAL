Please explain what is \"Family (biology)\"<>Family (Latin: familia, plural familiae) is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. It is classified between order and genus. A family may be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus. The official family names are Latin in origin; however, popular names are often used: for example, walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, but that family is commonly referred to as the \"walnut family\".\nWhat belongs to a family—or if a described family should be recognized at all—are proposed and determined by practicing taxonomists. There are no hard rules for describing or recognizing a family, but in plants, they can be characterized on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of plant species. Taxonomists often take different positions about descriptions, and there may be no broad consensus across the scientific community for some time. The publishing of new data and opinions often enables adjustments and consensus.<>In biology, a family is a taxonomic rank. It is a group of related organisms that share certain characteristics and are classified together within a larger taxonomic group, such as the order or class.\n\n\n\nFamilies are a level of classification in the classification of living organisms, ranking below an order and above a genus. They are generally characterized by a set of common features or characteristics that are shared by the members of the family.\n\n\n\nFor example, the family Felidae includes all species of cats, such as lions, tigers, and domestic cats. The family Canidae includes all species of dogs, such as wolves, foxes, and domestic dogs. The family Rosaceae includes plants such as roses, apples, and strawberries.\n\n\n\nFamilies are a useful way of grouping organisms because they allow scientists to identify and study the relationships between different groups of organisms. They also provide a way to classify and organize organisms for the purposes of scientific study and communication.<>wiki_csai
