Why does my cat lick things uncontrollably when I pet him ? He will just lick anything he sees when I pet him . It 's weird .... Explain like I'm five.<>I reckon it 's an instinct . You draw your hand over it 's fur and making it smooth , just like it would do while licking itself . Dogs that move their foot while being scratched , I think do the same thing - they are scratched so they start doing the move . Could be entirely wrong .<>Cats groom themselves by licking their fur to keep it clean and healthy. When you pet your cat, it may feel good to them and stimulate them to start grooming. Licking is a natural behavior for cats, and they may also lick other things, such as your hands or clothes, as a sign of affection. Cats have a special gland in their mouths that produces a substance called ptyalin, which helps them digest their food. Ptyalin also has a slightly salivary taste, which some people find pleasant. So, your cat may be licking things as a way of showing love and affection, or simply because it feels good to them.<>reddit_eli5
