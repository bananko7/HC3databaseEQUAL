If I helped my friend to file taxes; can I represent her on a phone call with FTB?<>In order for you to be able to talk to the FTB on someone's behalf, that someone has to submit form 3520. Note that since you're not a professional, this form must be paper-filed (CRTP, EA, CPA or attorneys can have this filed on-line). Once the form is accepted by the FTB, you can contact the FTB on behalf of your friend. Pay attention: you're going to represent the partnership, not the individual.<>Generally speaking, you cannot represent someone else on a phone call with the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) unless you are an authorized representative, such as an attorney or a tax professional with a power of attorney. The FTB will typically only communicate with the taxpayer or their authorized representative, as they are responsible for the accuracy of the information provided and any decisions made regarding their tax account.If you are not an authorized representative and you wish to assist your friend with their tax matters, you can still be a helpful resource by providing them with information and guidance. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the taxpayer to ensure that their taxes are filed accurately and on time.<>finance
