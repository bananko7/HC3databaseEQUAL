An abscessed tooth is a serious dental problem that needs to be treated by a dentist as soon as possible. The abscess, or pocket of pus, can be caused by a bacterial infection and can spread to other parts of your body if left untreated.\n\nIf you are experiencing pain and discomfort from an abscessed tooth, it is important to see a dentist as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can try to manage the pain by rinsing your mouth with warm salt water, taking over-the-counter pain medication, and applying a cold compress to your face to reduce swelling.\n\nIf you are feeling sick to your stomach and have other symptoms such as fever or difficulty swallowing, it is important to seek medical attention right away. Do not wait until your scheduled dental appointment to seek treatment.<>medicine
