How can USA get kicked out from the international space station if they funded 81 % of it ? I just do n't understand . URL_0 Explain like I'm five.<>We did n't get kicked out . Russia is n't letting us use their rockets anymore . There 's a big difference .<>The United States did not fund 81% of the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a cooperative project between five space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). Each agency has contributed resources, technology, and astronauts to the ISS, and all the member countries work together to operate the space station.\r\n\r\nIt's not possible for one country to get \"kicked out\" of the ISS because it's a collaborative project and all the member countries rely on each other to make it work. The ISS is a unique example of international cooperation in space, and it's an important symbol of the ability of countries to work together to achieve shared goals.<>reddit_eli5
