What made wolves easier to domesticate over other animals ? Why did we domesticate wolves over other , similar predators like bears or big cats ? Please explain like I'm five.<>They found humans to be helpful for getting food for cooperation . With similar tastes and agreeable hunting tactics some members of wolf 's would start to stick with the humans . These members would have had a good chance of survival and a good chance to pass down the genes that made them fond of cooperative humans . Over hundreds of years the wolf 's that stayed with humans became an entirely different subset .<>Wolves are thought to have been domesticated because they were easier to tame than other animals due to their social nature. Wolves live in packs and have a hierarchical social structure, with a dominant alpha male and female at the top. This social structure made it easier for humans to establish dominance over wolves and train them to do tasks.Bears and big cats, on the other hand, are generally more solitary animals and do not have the same kind of social structure. This makes them more difficult to tame and train. In addition, bears and big cats are often much larger and stronger than wolves, which can make them more dangerous to work with.Overall, it is likely that wolves were domesticated because they were more social, easier to train, and safer to work with than other large predators.<>reddit_eli5
