How come salvage yards only have cars that are older than 10 years ? I 've wondered this for quite some time . What do they do with the cars that are wrecked and less than 10 years old ? Explain like I'm five.<>Car parts from more recent cars are probably more immediately useful . If I 'm junking a 3 year old Camry , there 's only about a zillion other 3 year old Camry 's out there that could potentially need some parts from my wreck . If I have an 18 year old Dodge minivan , there 's a lot less dodge minivans out there than anybody 's willing to spend money fixing up , so it 'll just sit in the junkyard .<>Salvage yards typically only have older cars because they are no longer roadworthy or safe to drive. When a car is too damaged to be repaired and is no longer safe to be driven, it is often sold to a salvage yard. Salvage yards take these cars and sell the usable parts to people who need them to repair their own vehicles. Cars that are less than 10 years old and are damaged in a way that makes them unsafe to drive may also be sold to salvage yards. However, there are often stricter rules and regulations governing the sale and disposal of newer vehicles, so it may be more difficult for salvage yards to obtain these types of cars. In some cases, newer cars that are damaged in accidents may be repaired and returned to the road, rather than being sold to a salvage yard. This is more likely to happen if the damage is not too severe and the cost of repairing the car is not too high.<>reddit_eli5
